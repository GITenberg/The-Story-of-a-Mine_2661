    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHO SOUGHT IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a steep trail leading over the Monterey Coast Range. Concho was
      very tired, Concho was very dusty, Concho was very much disgusted. To
      Concho's mind there was but one relief for these insurmountable
      difficulties, and that lay in a leathern bottle slung over the machillas
      of his saddle. Concho raised the bottle to his lips, took a long draught,
      made a wry face, and ejaculated:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carajo!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that the bottle did not contain aguardiente, but had lately
      been filled in a tavern near Tres Pinos by an Irishman who sold had
      American whisky under that pleasing Castilian title. Nevertheless Concho
      had already nearly emptied the bottle, and it fell back against the saddle
      as yellow and flaccid as his own cheeks. Thus reinforced Concho turned to
      look at the valley behind him, from which he had climbed since noon. It
      was a sterile waste bordered here and there by arable fringes and valdas
      of meadow land, but in the main, dusty, dry, and forbidding. His eye
      rested for a moment on a low white cloud line on the eastern horizon, but
      so mocking and unsubstantial that it seemed to come and go as he gazed.
      Concho struck his forehead and winked his hot eyelids. Was it the Sierras
      or the cursed American whisky?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he recommenced the ascent. At times the half-worn, half-visible
      trail became utterly lost in the bare black outcrop of the ridge, but his
      sagacious mule soon found it again, until, stepping upon a loose boulder,
      she slipped and fell. In vain Concho tried to lift her from out the ruin
      of camp kettles, prospecting pans, and picks; she remained quietly
      recumbent, occasionally raising her head as if to contemplatively glance
      over the arid plain below. Then he had recourse to useless blows. Then he
      essayed profanity of a secular kind, such as "Assassin," "Thief," "Beast
      with a pig's head," "Food for the Bull's Horns," but with no effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he had recourse to the curse ecclesiastic:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Judas Iscariot! is it thus, renegade and traitor, thou leavest me,
      thy master, a league from camp and supper waiting? Stealer of the
      Sacrament, get up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no effect. Concho began to feel uneasy; never before had a mule of
      pious lineage failed to respond to this kind of exhortation. He made one
      more desperate attempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, defiler of the altar! lie not there! Look!" he threw his hand into
      the air, extending the fingers suddenly. "Behold, fiend! I exorcise thee!
      Ha! tremblest! Look but a little now,&mdash;see! Apostate! I&mdash;I&mdash;excommunicate
      thee,&mdash;Mula!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you kicking up such a devil of row down there for?" said a gruff
      voice from the rocks above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho shuddered. Could it be that the devil was really going to fly away
      with his mule? He dared not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come now," continued the voice, "you just let up on that mule, you d&mdash;&mdash;d
      old Greaser. Don't you see she's slipped her shoulder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alarmed as Concho was at the information, he could not help feeling to a
      certain extent relieved. She was lamed, but had not lost her standing as a
      good Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ventured to lift his eyes. A stranger&mdash;an Americano from his dress
      and accent&mdash;was descending the rocks toward him. He was a
      slight-built man with a dark, smooth face, that would have been quite
      commonplace and inexpressive but for his left eye, in which all that was
      villainous in him apparently centered. Shut that eye, and you had the
      features and expression of an ordinary man; cover up those features, and
      the eye shone out like Eblis's own. Nature had apparently observed this
      too, and had, by a paralysis of the nerve, ironically dropped the corner
      of the upper lid over it like a curtain, laughed at her handiwork, and
      turned him loose to prey upon a credulous world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing here?" said the stranger after he had assisted Concho
      in bringing the mule to her feet, and a helpless halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prospecting, Senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger turned his respectable right eye toward Concho, while his
      left looked unutterable scorn and wickedness over the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prospecting, what for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gold and silver, Senor,&mdash;yet for silver most."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of us there are four."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In camp,&mdash;a league beyond," explained the Mexican.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of this&mdash;much." Concho took from his saddle bags a lump of greyish
      iron ore, studded here and there with star points of pyrites. The stranger
      said nothing, but his eye looked a diabolical suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are lucky, friend Greaser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It IS silver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How know you this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my business. I'm a metallurgist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you can say what shall be silver and what is not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes,&mdash;see here!" The stranger took from his saddle bags a little
      leather case containing some half dozen phials. One, enwrapped in
      dark-blue paper, he held up to Concho.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This contains a preparation of silver."
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho's eyes sparkled, but he looked doubtingly at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get me some water in your pan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho emptied his water bottle in his prospecting pan and handed it to
      the stranger. He dipped a dried blade of grass in the bottle and then let
      a drop fall from its tip in the water. The water remained unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now throw a little salt in the water," said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho did so. Instantly a white film appeared on the surface, and
      presently the whole mass assumed a milky hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho crossed himself hastily, "Mother of God, it is magic!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is chloride of silver, you darned fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not content with this cheap experiment, the stranger then took Concho's
      breath away by reddening some litmus paper with the nitrate, and then
      completely knocked over the simple Mexican by restoring its color by
      dipping it in the salt water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall try me this," said Concho, offering his iron ore to the
      stranger;&mdash;"you shall use the silver and the salt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so fast my friend," answered the stranger; "in the first place this
      ore must be melted, and then a chip taken and put in shape like this,&mdash;and
      that is worth something, my Greaser cherub. No, sir, a man don't spend all
      his youth at Freiburg and Heidelburg to throw away his science
      gratuitously on the first Greaser he meets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will cost&mdash;eh&mdash;how much?" said the Mexican eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should say it would take about a hundred dollars and expenses to&mdash;to&mdash;find
      silver in that ore. But once you've got it there&mdash;you're all right
      for tons of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it," said the now excited Mexican. "You shall have it of
      us,&mdash;the four! You shall come to our camp and shall melt it,&mdash;and
      show the silver, and&mdash;enough! Come!" and in his feverishness he
      clutched the hand of his companion as if to lead him forth at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do with your mule?" said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, Holy Mother,&mdash;what, indeed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look yer," said the stranger, with a grim smile, "she won't stray far,
      I'll be bound. I've an extra pack mule above here; you can ride on her,
      and lead me into camp, and to-morrow come back for your beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor honest Concho's heart sickened at the prospect of leaving behind the
      tired servant he had objurgated so strongly a moment before, but the love
      of gold was uppermost. "I will come back to thee, little one, to-morrow, a
      rich man. Meanwhile, wait thou here, patient one,&mdash;Adios!&mdash;thou
      smallest of mules,&mdash;Adios!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And, seizing the stranger's hand, he clambered up the rocky ledge until
      they reached the summit. Then the stranger turned and gave one sweep of
      his malevolent eye over the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherefore, in after years, when their story was related, with the devotion
      of true Catholic pioneers, they named the mountain "La Canada de la
      Visitacion del Diablo," "The Gulch of the Visitation of the Devil," the
      same being now the boundary lines of one of the famous Mexican land
      grants.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHO FOUND IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Concho was so impatient to reach the camp and deliver his good news to his
      companions that more than once the stranger was obliged to command him to
      slacken his pace. "Is it not enough, you infernal Greaser, that you lame
      your own mule, but you must try your hand on mine? Or am I to put Jinny
      down among the expenses?" he added with a grin and a slight lifting of his
      baleful eyelid.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had ridden a mile along the ridge, they began to descend again
      toward the valley. Vegetation now sparingly bordered the trail, clumps of
      chemisal, an occasional manzanita bush, and one or two dwarfed "buckeyes"
      rooted their way between the interstices of the black-gray rock. Now and
      then, in crossing some dry gully, worn by the overflow of winter torrents
      from above, the grayish rock gloom was relieved by dull red and brown
      masses of color, and almost every overhanging rock bore the mark of a
      miner's pick. Presently, as they rounded the curving flank of the
      mountain, from a rocky bench below them, a thin ghost-like stream of smoke
      seemed to be steadily drawn by invisible hands into the invisible ether.
      "It is the camp," said Concho, gleefully; "I will myself forward to
      prepare them for the stranger," and before his companion could detain him,
      he had disappeared at a sharp canter around the curve of the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, the stranger took a more leisurely pace, which left him
      ample time for reflection. Scamp as he was, there was something in the
      simple credulity of poor Concho that made him uneasy. Not that his moral
      consciousness was touched, but he feared that Concho's companions might,
      knowing Concho's simplicity, instantly suspect him of trading upon it. He
      rode on in a deep study. Was he reviewing his past life? A vagabond by
      birth and education, a swindler by profession, an outcast by reputation,
      without absolutely turning his back upon respectability, he had trembled
      on the perilous edge of criminality ever since his boyhood. He did not
      scruple to cheat these Mexicans,&mdash;they were a degraded race,&mdash;and
      for a moment he felt almost an accredited agent of progress and
      civilization. We never really understand the meaning of enlightenment
      until we begin to use it aggressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few paces further on four figures appeared in the now gathering darkness
      of the trail. The stranger quickly recognized the beaming smile of Concho,
      foremost of the party. A quick glance at the faces of the others satisfied
      him that while they lacked Concho's good humor, they certainly did not
      surpass him in intellect. "Pedro" was a stout vaquero. "Manuel" was a slim
      half-breed and ex-convert of the Mission of San Carmel, and "Miguel" a
      recent butcher of Monterey. Under the benign influences of Concho that
      suspicion with which the ignorant regard strangers died away, and the
      whole party escorted the stranger&mdash;who had given his name as Mr.
      Joseph Wiles&mdash;to their camp-fire. So anxious were they to begin their
      experiments that even the instincts of hospitality were forgotten, and it
      was not until Mr. Wiles&mdash;now known as "Don Jose"&mdash;sharply
      reminded them that he wanted some "grub," that they came to their senses.
      When the frugal meal of tortillas, frijoles, salt pork, and chocolate was
      over, an oven was built of the dark-red rock brought from the ledge before
      them, and an earthenware jar, glazed by some peculiar local process,
      tightly fitted over it, and packed with clay and sods. A fire was speedily
      built of pine boughs continually brought from a wooded ravine below, and
      in a few moments the furnace was in full blast. Mr. Wiles did not
      participate in these active preparations, except to give occasional
      directions between his teeth, which were contemplatively fixed over a clay
      pipe as he lay comfortably on his back on the ground. Whatever enjoyment
      the rascal may have had in their useless labors he did not show it, but it
      was observed that his left eye often followed the broad figure of the
      ex-vaquero, Pedro, and often dwelt on that worthy's beetling brows and
      half-savage face. Meeting that baleful glance once, Pedro growled out an
      oath, but could not resist a hideous fascination that caused him again and
      again to seek it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was weird enough without Wiles's eye to add to its wild
      picturesqueness. The mountain towered above,&mdash;a heavy Rembrandtish
      mass of black shadow,&mdash;sharply cut here and there against a sky so
      inconceivably remote that the world-sick soul must have despaired of ever
      reaching so far, or of climbing its steel-blue walls. The stars were
      large, keen, and brilliant, but cold and steadfast. They did not dance nor
      twinkle in their adamantine setting. The furnace fire painted the faces of
      the men an Indian red, glanced on brightly colored blanket and serape, but
      was eventually caught and absorbed in the waiting shadows of the black
      mountain, scarcely twenty feet from the furnace door. The low, half-sung,
      half-whispered foreign speech of the group, the roaring of the furnace,
      and the quick, sharp yelp of a coyote on the plain below were the only
      sounds that broke the awful silence of the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost dawn when it was announced that the ore had fused. And it
      was high time, for the pot was slowly sinking into the fast-crumbling
      oven. Concho uttered a jubilant "God and Liberty," but Don Jose Wiles bade
      him be silent and bring stakes to support the pot. Then Don Jose bent over
      the seething mass. It was for a moment only. But in that moment this
      accomplished metallurgist, Mr. Joseph Wiles, had quietly dropped a silver
      half dollar into the pot!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he charged them to keep up the fires and went to sleep&mdash;all but
      one eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dawn came with dull beacon fires on the near hill tops, and, far in the
      East, roses over the Sierran snow. Birds twittering in the alder fringes a
      mile below, and the creaking of wagon wheels,&mdash;the wagon itself a
      mere cloud of dust in the distant road,&mdash;were heard distinctly. Then
      the melting pot was solemnly broken by Don Jose, and the glowing
      incandescent mass turned into the road to cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the metallurgist chipped a small fragment from the mass and
      pounded it, and chipped another smaller piece and pounded that, and then
      subjected it to acid, and then treated it to a salt bath which became at
      once milky,&mdash;and at last produced a white something,&mdash;mirabile
      dictu!&mdash;two cents' worth of silver!
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho shouted with joy; the rest gazed at each other doubtingly and
      distrustfully; companions in poverty, they began to diverge and suspect
      each other in prosperity. Wiles's left eye glanced ironically from the one
      to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is the hundred dollars, Don Jose," said Pedro, handing the gold to
      Wiles with a decidedly brusque intimation that the services and presence
      of a stranger were no longer required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles took the money with a gracious smile and a wink that sent Pedro's
      heart into his boots, and was turning away, when a cry from Manuel stopped
      him. "The pot,&mdash;the pot,&mdash;it has leaked! look! behold! see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been cleaning away the crumbled fragments of the furnace to get
      ready for breakfast, and had disclosed a shining pool of QUICKSILVER!
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles started, cast a rapid glance around the group, saw in a flash that
      the metal was unknown to them,&mdash;and then said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not silver."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon, Senor, it is, and still molten." Wiles stooped and ran his
      fingers through the shining metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother of God,&mdash;what is it then?&mdash;magic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, only base metal." But here, Concho, emboldened by Wiles's experiment,
      attempted to seize a handful of the glistening mass, that instantly broke
      through his fingers in a thousand tiny spherules, and even sent a few
      globules up his shirt sleeves, until he danced around in mingled fear and
      childish pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is not worth the taking?" queried Pedro of Wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles's right eye and bland face were turned toward the speaker, but his
      malevolent left was glancing at the dull red-brown rock on the hill side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"&mdash;and turning abruptly away, he proceeded to saddle his mule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manuel, Miguel, and Pedro, left to themselves, began talking earnestly
      together, while Concho, now mindful of his crippled mule, made his way
      back to the trail where he had left her. But she was no longer there.
      Constant to her master through beatings and bullyings, she could not stand
      incivility and inattention. There are certain qualities of the sex that
      belong to all animated nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inconsolable, footsore, and remorseful, Concho returned to the camp and
      furnace, three miles across the rocky ridge. But what was his astonishment
      on arriving to find the place deserted of man, mule, and camp equipage.
      Concho called aloud. Only the echoing rocks grimly answered him. Was it a
      trick? Concho tried to laugh. Ah&mdash;yes&mdash;a good one,&mdash;a joke,&mdash;no&mdash;no&mdash;they
      HAD deserted him. And then poor Concho bowed his head to the ground, and
      falling on his face, cried as if his honest heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tempest passed in a moment; it was not Concho's nature to suffer long
      nor brood over an injury. As he raised his head again his eye caught the
      shimmer of the quicksilver,&mdash;that pool of merry antic metal that had
      so delighted him an hour before. In a few moments Concho was again
      disporting with it; chasing it here and there, rolling it in his palms and
      laughing with boy-like glee at its elusive freaks and fancies. "Ah,
      sprightly one,&mdash;skipjack,&mdash;there thou goest,&mdash;come here.
      This way,&mdash;now I have thee, little one,&mdash;come, muchacha,&mdash;come
      and kiss me," until he had quite forgotten the defection of his
      companions. And even when he shouldered his sorry pack, he was fain to
      carry his playmate away with him in his empty leathern flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet I fancy the sun looked kindly on him as he strode cheerily down
      the black mountain side, and his step was none the less free nor light
      that he carried with him neither the brilliant prospects nor the crime of
      his late comrades.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHO CLAIMED IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The fog had already closed in on Monterey, and was now rolling, a white,
      billowy sea above, that soon shut out the blue breakers below. Once or
      twice in descending the mountain Concho had overhung the cliff and looked
      down upon the curving horse-shoe of a bay below him,&mdash;distant yet
      many miles. Earlier in the afternoon he had seen the gilt cross on the
      white-faced Mission flare in the sunlight, but now all was gone. By the
      time he reached the highway of the town it was quite dark, and he plunged
      into the first fonda at the wayside, and endeavored to forget his woes and
      his weariness in aguardiente. But Concho's head ached, and his back ached,
      and he was so generally distressed that he bethought him of a medico,&mdash;an
      American doctor,&mdash;lately come into the town, who had once treated
      Concho and his mule with apparently the same medicine, and after the same
      heroic fashion. Concho reasoned, not illogically, that if he were to be
      physicked at all he ought to get the worth of his money. The grotesque
      extravagance of life, of fruit and vegetables, in California was
      inconsistent with infinitesimal doses. In Concho's previous illness the
      doctor had given him a dozen 4 grain quinine powders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day the grateful Mexican walked into the Doctor's office&mdash;cured.
      The Doctor was gratified until, on examination, it appeared that to save
      trouble, and because his memory was poor, Concho had taken all the powders
      in one dose. The Doctor shrugged his shoulders and&mdash;altered his
      practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Dr. Guild, as Concho sank down exhaustedly in one of the
      Doctor's two chairs, "what now? Have you been sleeping again in the tule
      marshes, or are you upset with commissary whisky? Come, have it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Concho declared that the devil was in his stomach, that Judas Iscariot
      had possessed himself of his spine, that imps were in his forehead, and
      that his feet had been scourged by Pontius Pilate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means 'blue mass,'" said the Doctor. And gave it to him,&mdash;a
      bolus as large as a musket ball, and as heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho took it on the spot, and turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no money, Senor Medico."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind. It's only a dollar, the price of the medicine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho looked guilty at having gulped down so much cash. Then he said
      timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no money, but I have got here what is fine and jolly. It is
      yours." And he handed over the contents of the precious tin can he had
      brought with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor took it, looked at the shivering volatile mass and said, "Why
      this is quicksilver!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho laughed, "Yes, very quick silver, so!" and he snapped his fingers
      to show its sprightliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor's face grew earnest; "Where did you get this, Concho?" he
      finally asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ran from the pot in the mountains beyond."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor looked incredulous. Then Concho related the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you find that spot again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madre de Dios, yes,&mdash;I have a mule there; may the devil fly away
      with her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you say your comrades saw this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you say they afterwards left you,&mdash;deserted you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They did, ingrates!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor arose and shut his office door. "Hark ye, Concho," he said,
      "that bit of medicine I gave you just now was worth a dollar, it was worth
      a dollar because the material of which it was composed was made from the
      stuff you have in that can,&mdash;quicksilver or mercury. It is one of the
      most valuable of metals, especially in a gold-mining country. My good
      fellow, if you know where to find enough of it, your fortune is made."
    </p>
    <p>
      Concho rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, was the rock you built your furnace of red?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Si, Senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And brown?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Si, Senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And crumbled under the heat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did you see much of this red rock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mountain mother is in travail with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure that your comrades have not taken possession of the mountain
      mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By claiming its discovery under the mining laws, or by pre-emption?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how will you, single-handed, fight the four; for I doubt not your
      scientific friend has a hand in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my Concho, but suppose I take the fight off your hands. Now, here's
      a proposition: I will get half a dozen Americanos to go in with you. You
      will have to get money to work the mine,&mdash;you will need funds. You
      shall share half with them. They will take the risk, raise the money, and
      protect you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said Concho, nodding his head and winking his eyes rapidly.
      "Bueno!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will return in ten minutes," said the Doctor, taking his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was as good as his word. In ten minutes he returned with six original
      locaters, a board of directors, a president, secretary, and a deed of
      incorporation of the 'Blue Mass Quicksilver Mining Co.' This latter was a
      delicate compliment to the Doctor, who was popular. The President added to
      these necessary articles a revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it," he said, handing over the weapon to Concho. "Take it; my horse
      is outside; take that, ride like h&mdash;l and hang on to the claim until
      we come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment Concho was in the saddle. Then the mining director
      lapsed into the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know," said Dr. Guild, doubtfully, "if in your present condition
      you ought to travel. You have just taken a powerful medicine," and the
      Doctor looked hypocritically concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah,&mdash;the devil!" laughed Concho, "what is the quicksilver that is IN
      to that which is OUT? Hoopa, la Mula!" and, with a clatter of hoofs and
      jingle of spurs, was presently lost in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were none too soon, gentlemen," said the American Alcalde, as he drew
      up before the Doctor's door. "Another company has just been incorporated
      for the same location, I reckon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three Mexicans,&mdash;Pedro, Manuel, and Miguel, headed by that d&mdash;&mdash;d
      cock-eyed Sydney Duck, Wiles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manuel and Miguel, only. The others are over at Tres Pinos lally-gaging
      Roscommon and trying to rope him in to pay off their whisky bills at his
      grocery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that's so we needn't start before sunrise, for they're sure to get
      roaring drunk."
    </p>
    <p>
      And this legitimate successor of the grave Mexican Alcaldes, having thus
      delivered his impartial opinion, rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Concho the redoubtable, Concho the fortunate, spared neither
      riata nor spur. The way was dark, the trail obscure and at times even
      dangerous, and Concho, familiar as he was with these mountain fastnesses,
      often regretted his sure-footed Francisquita. "Care not, O Concho," he
      would say to himself, "'tis but a little while, only a little while, and
      thou shalt have another Francisquita to bless thee. Eh, skipjack, there
      was a fine music to thy dancing. A dollar for an ounce,&mdash;'tis as good
      as silver, and merrier." Yet for all his good spirits he kept a sharp
      lookout at certain bends of the mountain trail; not for assassins or
      brigands, for Concho was physically courageous, but for the Evil One, who,
      in various forms, was said to lurk in the Santa Cruz Range, to the great
      discomfort of all true Catholics. He recalled the incident of Ignacio, a
      muleteer of the Franciscan Friars, who, stopping at the Angelus to repeat
      the Credo, saw Luzbel plainly in the likeness of a monstrous grizzly bear,
      mocking him by sitting on his haunches and lifting his paws, clasped
      together, as if in prayer. Nevertheless, with one hand grasping his reins
      and his rosary, and the other clutching his whisky flask and revolver, he
      fared on so rapidly that he reached the summit as the earlier streaks of
      dawn were outlining the far-off Sierran peaks. Tethering his horse on a
      strip of tableland, he descended cautiously afoot until he reached the
      bench, the wall of red rock and the crumbled and dismantled furnace. It
      was as he had left it that morning; there was no trace of recent human
      visitation. Revolver in hand, Concho examined every cave, gully, and
      recess, peered behind trees, penetrated copses of buckeye and manzanita,
      and listened. There was no sound but the faint soughing of the wind over
      the pines below him. For a while he paced backward and forward with a
      vague sense of being a sentinel, but his mercurial nature soon rebelled
      against this monotony, and soon the fatigues of the day began to tell upon
      him. Recourse to his whisky flask only made him the drowsier, until at
      last he was fain to lie down and roll himself up tightly in his blanket.
      The next moment he was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      His horse neighed twice from the summit, but Concho heard him not. Then
      the brush crackled on the ledge above him, a small fragment of rock rolled
      near his feet, but he stirred not. And then two black figures were
      outlined on the crags beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "St-t-t!" whispered a voice. "There is one lying beside the furnace." The
      speech was Spanish, but the voice was Wiles's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other figure crept cautiously to the edge of the crag and looked over.
      "It is Concho, the imbecile," said Pedro, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if he should not be alone, or if he should waken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will watch and wait. Go you and affix the notification."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles disappeared. Pedro began to creep down the face of the rocky ledge,
      supporting himself by chemisal and brush-wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Pedro stood beside the unconscious man. Then he looked
      cautiously around. The figure of his companion was lost in the shadow of
      the rocks above; only a slight crackle of brush betrayed his whereabouts.
      Suddenly Pedro flung his serape over the sleeper's head, and then threw
      his powerful frame and tremendous weight full upon Concho's upturned face,
      while his strong arms clasped the blanket-pinioned limbs of his victim.
      There was a momentary upheaval, a spasm, and a struggle; but the
      tightly-rolled blanket clung to the unfortunate man like cerements.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no noise, no outcry, no sound of struggle. There was nothing to
      be seen but the peaceful, prostrate figures of the two men darkly outlined
      on the ledge. They might have been sleeping in each other's arms. In the
      black silence the stealthy tread of Wiles in the brush above was
      distinctly audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the struggles grew fainter. Then a whisper from the crags:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't see you. What are you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watching!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sleeps he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sleeps!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soundly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soundly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After the manner of the dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "After the fashion of the dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The last tremor had ceased. Pedro rose as Wiles descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is ready," said Wiles; "you are a witness of my placing the
      notifications?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a witness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But of this one?" pointing to Concho. "Shall we leave him here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A drunken imbecile,&mdash;why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles turned his left eye on the speaker. They chanced to be standing
      nearly in the same attitude they had stood the preceding night. Pedro
      uttered a cry and an imprecation, "Carramba! Take your devil's eye from
      me! What see you? Eh,&mdash;what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, good Pedro," said Wiles, turning his bland right cheek to Pedro.
      The infuriated and half-frightened ex-vaquero returned the long knife he
      had half-drawn from its sheath, and growled surlily: "Go on then! But keep
      thou on that side, and I will on this." And so, side by side, listening,
      watching, distrustful of all things, but mainly of each other, they stole
      back and up into those shadows from which they might like evil spirits
      have been poetically evoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half hour passed, in which the east brightened, flashed, and again
      melted into gold. And then the sun came up haughtily, and a fog that had
      stolen across the summit in the night arose and fled up the mountain side,
      tearing its white robes in its guilty haste, and leaving them fluttering
      from tree and crag and scar. A thousand tiny blades, nestling in the
      crevices of rocks, nurtured in storms and rocked by the trade winds,
      stretched their wan and feeble arms toward Him; but Concho the strong,
      Concho the brave, Concho the light-hearted spake not nor stirred.

    <h3>
      WHO TOOK IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was persistent neighing on the summit. Concho's horse wanted his
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      This protestation reached the ears of a party ascending the mountain from
      its western face. To one of the party it was familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, blank it all, that's Chiquita. That d&mdash;&mdash;d Mexican's lying
      drunk somewhere," said the President of the B. M. Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like the look of this at all," said Dr. Guild, as they rode up
      beside the indignant animal. "If it had been an American, it might have
      been carelessness, but no Mexican ever forgets his beast. Drive ahead,
      boys; we may be too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour they came in sight of the ledge below, the crumbled
      furnace, and the motionless figure of Concho, wrapped in a blanket, lying
      prone in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you so,&mdash;drunk!" said the President.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor looked grave, but did not speak. They dismounted and picketed
      their horses. Then crept on all fours to the ledge above the furnace.
      There was a cry from Secretary Gibbs, "Look yer. Some fellar has been
      jumping us, boys. See these notices."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two notices on canvas affixed to the rock, claiming the ground,
      and signed by Pedro, Manuel, Miguel, Wiles, and Roscommon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was done, Doctor, while your trustworthy Greaser locater,&mdash;d&mdash;n
      him,&mdash;lay there drunk. What's to be done now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Doctor was making his way to the unfortunate cause of their
      defeat, lying there quite mute to their reproaches. The others followed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor knelt beside Concho, unrolled him, placed his hand upon his
      wrist, his ear over his heart, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. He got medicine of you last night. This comes of your d&mdash;&mdash;d
      heroic practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Doctor was too much occupied to heed the speaker's raillery. He
      had peered into Concho's protuberant eye, opened his mouth, and gazed at
      the swollen tongue, and then suddenly rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tear down those notices, boys, but keep them. Put up your own. Don't be
      alarmed, you will not be interfered with, for here is murder added to
      robbery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the Doctor, excitedly, "I'll take my oath on any inquest that
      this man was strangled to death. He was surprised while asleep. Look
      here." He pointed to the revolver still in Concho's stiffening hand, which
      the murdered man had instantly cocked, but could not use in the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so," said the President, "no man goes to sleep with a cocked
      revolver. What's to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything," said the Doctor. "This deed was committed within the last
      two hours; the body is still warm. The murderer did not come our way, or
      we should have met him on the trail. He is, if anywhere, between here and
      Tres Pinos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen," said the President, with a slight preparatory and half
      judicial cough, "two of you will stay here and stick! The others will
      follow me to Tres Pinos. The law has been outraged. You understand the
      Court!"
    </p>
    <p>
      By some odd influence the little group of half-cynical, half-trifling, and
      wholly reckless men had become suddenly sober, earnest citizens. They
      said, "Go on," nodded their heads, and betook themselves to their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had we not better wait for the inquest and swear out a warrant?" said the
      Secretary, cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many men have we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said the President, summing up the Revised Statutes of the State
      of California in one strong sentence; "then we don't want no d&mdash;&mdash;d
      warrant."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHO HAD A LIEN ON IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was high noon at Tres Pinos. The three pines from which it gained its
      name, in the dusty road and hot air, seemed to smoke from their balsamic
      spires. There was a glare from the road, a glare from the sky, a glare
      from the rocks, a glare from the white canvas roofs of the few shanties
      and cabins which made up the village. There was even a glare from the
      unpainted red-wood boards of Roscommon's grocery and tavern, and a
      tendency of the warping floor of the veranda to curl up beneath the feet
      of the intruder. A few mules, near the watering trough, had shrunk within
      the scant shadow of the corral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grocery business of Mr. Roscommon, although adequate and sufficient
      for the village, was not exhausting nor overtaxing to the proprietor; the
      refilling of the pork and flour barrel of the average miner was the work
      of a brief hour on Saturday nights, but the daily replenishment of the
      average miner with whisky was arduous and incessant. Roscommon spent more
      time behind his bar than his grocer's counter. Add to this the fact that a
      long shed-like extension or wing bore the legend, "Cosmopolitan Hotel,
      Board or Lodging by the Day or Week. M. Roscommon," and you got an idea of
      the variety of the proprietor's functions. The "hotel," however, was more
      directly under the charge of Mrs. Roscommon, a lady of thirty years,
      strong, truculent, and good-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Roscommon had early adopted the theory that most of his customers were
      insane, and were to be alternately bullied or placated, as the case might
      be. Nothing that occurred, no extravagance of speech nor act, ever ruffled
      his equilibrium, which was as dogged and stubborn as it was outwardly
      calm. When not serving liquor, or in the interval while it was being
      drank, he was always wiping his counter with an exceedingly dirty towel,&mdash;or
      indeed anything that came handy. Miners, noticing this purely perfunctory
      habit, occasionally supplied him slily with articles inconsistent with
      their service,&mdash;fragments of their shirts and underclothing, flour
      sacking, tow, and once with a flannel petticoat of his wife's, stolen from
      the line in the back-yard. Roscommon would continue his wiping without
      looking up, but yet conscious of the presence of each customer. "And it's
      not another dhrop ye'll git, Jack Brown, until ye've wiped out the black
      score that stands agin ye." "And it's there ye are, darlint, and it's
      here's the bottle that's been lukin' for ye sins Saturday." "And fwhot hev
      you done with the last I sent ye, ye divil of a McCorkle, and here's me
      back that's bruk entoirely wid dipping intil the pork barl to giv ye the
      best sides, and ye spending yur last cint on a tare into Gilroy. Whist!
      and if it's fer foighting ye are, boys, there's an illigant bit of sod
      beyant the corral, and it may be meself'll come out with a shtick and be
      sociable."
    </p>
    <p>
      On this particular day, however, Mr. Roscommon was not in his usual
      spirits, and when the clatter of horses' hoofs before the door announced
      the approach of strangers, he absolutely ceased wiping his counter and
      looked up as Dr. Guild, the President, and Secretary of the new Company
      strode into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are looking," said the President, "for a man by the name of Wiles, and
      three Mexicans known as Pedro, Manuel, and Miguel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, and I hope ye'll foind 'em. And if ye'll git from 'em the score
      I've got agin 'em, darlint, I'll add a blessing to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh at this from the bystanders, who, somehow, resented the
      intrusion of these strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear you will find it no laughing matter, gentlemen," said Dr. Guild, a
      little stiffly, "when I tell you that a murder has been committed, and the
      men I am seeking within an hour of that murder put up that notice signed
      by their names," and Dr. Guild displayed the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathless silence among the crowd as they eagerly pressed
      around the Doctor. Only Roscommon kept on wiping his counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will observe, gentlemen, that the name of Roscommon also appears on
      this paper as one of the original beaters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And sure, darlint," said Roscommon, without looking up, "if ye've no
      better ividince agin them boys then you have forninst me, it's home ye'd
      bether be riding to wanst. For it's meself as hasn't sturred fut out of
      the store the day and noight,&mdash;more betoken as the boys I've sarved
      kin testify."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, Ross, right," chorused the crowd, "We've been running the old
      man all night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how comes your name on this paper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O murdher! will ye listen to him, boys? As if every felly that owed me a
      whisky bill didn't come to me and say, 'Ah, Misther Roscommon,' or
      'Moike,' as the case moight be, sure it's an illigant sthrike I've made
      this day, and it's meself that has put down your name as an original
      locater, and yer fortune's made, Mr. Roscommon, and will yer fill me up
      another quart for the good luck betune you and me. Ah, but ask Jack Brown
      over yar if it isn't sick that I am of his original locations."
    </p>
    <p>
      The laugh that followed this speech, and its practical application,
      convinced the party that they had blundered, that they could obtain no
      clue to the real culprits here, and that any attempt by threats would meet
      violent opposition. Nevertheless the Doctor was persistent:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you see these men last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did I see them, is it? Bedad, what with sarvin up the liquor and
      keeping me counters dry and swate, I never see them at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so, Ross," chorused the crowd again, to whom the whole proceeding
      was delightfully farcical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can tell you, gentlemen," said the Doctor, stiffly, "that they
      were in Monterey last night, that they did not return on that trail this
      morning, and that they must have passed here at daybreak."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, which the Doctor regretted as soon as delivered, the
      party rode away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Roscommon resumed his service and counter wiping. But late that night,
      when the bar was closed and the last loiterer was summarily ejected, Mr.
      Roscommon, in the conjugal privacy of his chamber, produced a
      legal-looking paper. "Read it, Maggie, darlint, for it's meself never had
      the larning nor the parts."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Roscommon took the paper:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shure, it's law papers, making over some property to yis. O Moike! ye
      havn't been spekilating!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whist! and fwhotz that durty gray paper wid the sales and flourishes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faix, it bothers me intoirely. Shure it oin't in English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whist! Maggie, it's a Spanish grant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Spanish grant? O Moike, and what did ye giv for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Roscommon laid his finger beside his nose and said softly, "Whishky!"

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW A GRANT WAS GOT FOR IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      While the Blue Mass Company, with more zeal than discretion, were actively
      pursuing Pedro and Wiles over the road to Tres Pinos, Senors Miguel and
      Manuel were comfortably seated in a fonda at Monterey, smoking cigarritos
      and discussing their late discovery. But they were in no better mood than
      their late companions, and it appeared from their conversation that in an
      evil moment they had sold out their interest in the alleged silver mine to
      Wiles and Pedro for a few hundred dollars,&mdash;succumbing to what they
      were assured would be an active opposition on the part of the Americanos.
      The astute reader will easily understand that the accomplished Mr. Wiles
      did not inform them of its value as a quicksilver mine, although he was
      obliged to impart his secret to Pedro as a necessary accomplice and
      reckless coadjutor. That Pedro felt no qualms of conscience in thus
      betraying his two comrades may be inferred from his recent direct and
      sincere treatment of Concho, and that he would, if occasion offered or
      policy made it expedient, as calmly obliterate Mr. Wiles, that gentleman
      himself never for a moment doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we had waited but a little he would have given more,&mdash;this
      cock-eye!" regretted Manuel querulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a peso," said Miguel, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why, my Miguel? Thou knowest we could have worked the mine
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, and lost even that labor. Look you, little brother. Show to me now
      the Mexican that has ever made a real of a mine in California. How many,
      eh? None! Not a one. Who owns the Mexican's mine, eh? Americanos! Who
      takes the money from the Mexican's mine? Americanos! Thou rememberest
      Briones, who spent a gold mine to make a silver one? Who has the lands and
      house of Briones? Americanos! Who has the cattle of Briones? Americanos!
      Who has the mine of Briones? Americanos! Who has the silver Briones never
      found? Americanos! Always the same! Forever! Ah! carramba!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Evil One evidently took it into his head and horns to worry and
      toss these men&mdash;comparatively innocent as they were&mdash;still
      further, for a purpose. For presently to them appeared one Victor Garcia,
      whilom a clerk of the Ayuntamiento, who rallied them over aguardiente, and
      told them the story of the quicksilver discovery, and the two mining
      claims taken out that night by Concho and Wiles. Whereat Manuel exploded
      with profanity and burnt blue with sulphurous malediction; but Miguel, the
      recent ecclesiastic, sat livid and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally came a pause in Manuel's bombardment, and something like this
      conversation took place between the cooler actors:
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel (thoughtfully). "When was it thou didst petition for lands in the
      valley, friend Victor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor (amazedly). "Never! It is a sterile waste. Am I a fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel (softly). "Thou didst. Of thy Governor, Micheltorena. I have seen
      the application."
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor (beginning to appreciate a rodential odor). "Si! I had forgotten.
      Art thou sure it was in the valley?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel (persuasively). "In the valley and up the falda."*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Falda, or valda, i. e., that part of the skirt of a
     woman's robe that breaks upon the ground, and is also
     applied to the final slope of a hill, from the angle that it
     makes upon the level plain.
</pre>
    <p>
      Victor (with decision). "Certainly. Of a verity,&mdash;the falda
      likewise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel (eying Victor). "And yet thou hadst not the grant. Painful is it
      that it should have been burned with the destruction of the other
      archives, by the Americanos at Monterey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor (cautiously feeling his way). "Possiblemente."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel. "It might be wise to look into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor (bluntly). "As why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel. "For our good and thine, friend Victor. We bring thee a discovery;
      thou bringest us thy skill, thy experience, thy government knowledge,&mdash;thy
      Custom House paper."*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Grants, applications, and official notifications, under
     the Spanish Government, were drawn on a stamped paper known
     as custom House paper.
</pre>
    <p>
      Manuel (breaking in drunkenly). "But for what? We are Mexicans. Are we not
      fated? We shall lose. Who shall keep the Americanos off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel. "We shall take ONE American in! Ha! seest thou? This American
      comrade shall bribe his courts, his corregidores. After a little he shall
      supply the men who invent the machine of steam, the mill, the furnace,
      eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor. "But who is he,&mdash;not to steal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel. "He is that man of Ireland, a good Catholic, at Tres Pinos."
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor and Manuel (omnes). "Roscommon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel. "Of the same. We shall give him a share for the provisions, for
      the tools, for the aguardiente. It is of the Irish that the Americanos
      have great fear. It is of them that the votes are made,&mdash;that the
      President is chosen. It is of him that they make the Alcalde in San
      Francisco. And we are of the Church like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      They said "Bueno" altogether, and for the moment appeared to be upheld by
      a religious enthusiasm,&mdash;a joint confession of faith that meant
      death, destruction, and possibly forgery, as against the men who thought
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      This spiritual harmony did away with all practical consideration and
      doubt. "I have a little niece," said Victor, "whose work with the pen is
      marvellous. If one says to her, 'Carmen, copy me this, or the other one,'&mdash;even
      if it be copper-plate,&mdash;look you it is done, and you cannot know of
      which is the original. Madre de Dios! the other day she makes me a rubric*
      of the Governor, Pio Pico, the same, identical. Thou knowest her, Miguel.
      She asked concerning thee yesterday."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Spanish "rubric" is the complicated flourish attached
     to a signature, and is as individual and characteristic as
     the handwriting.
</pre>
    <p>
      With the embarrassment of an underbred man, Miguel tried to appear
      unconcerned, but failed dismally. Indeed, I fear that the black eyes of
      Carmen had already done their perfect and accepted work, and had partly
      induced the application for Victor's aid. He, however, dissembled so far
      as to ask:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But will she not know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But will she not talk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if I say nay, and if thou&mdash;eh, Miguel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This bit of flattery (which, by the way, was a lie, for Victor's niece did
      not incline favorably to Miguel), had its effect. They shook hands over
      the table. "But," said Miguel, "what is to be done must be done now." "At
      the moment," said Victor, "and thou shalt see it done. Eh? Does it content
      thee? then come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel nodded to Manuel. "We will return in an hour; wait thou here."
    </p>
    <p>
      They filed out into the dark, irregular street. Fate led them to pass the
      office of Dr. Guild at the moment that Concho mounted his horse. The
      shadows concealed them from their rival, but they overheard the last
      injunctions of the President to the unlucky Concho.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou hearest?" said Miguel, clutching his companion's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Victor. "But let him ride, my friend; in one hour we shall
      have that that shall arrive YEARS before him," and with a complacent
      chuckle they passed unseen and unheard until, abruptly turning a corner,
      they stopped before a low adobe house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had once been a somewhat pretentious dwelling, but had evidently
      followed the fortunes of its late owner, Don Juan Briones, who had offered
      it as a last sop to the three-headed Cerberus that guarded the El Refugio
      Plutonean treasures, and who had swallowed it in a single gulp. It was in
      very bad case. The furrows of its red-tiled roof looked as if they were
      the results of age and decrepitude. Its best room had a musty smell; there
      was the dampness of deliquescence in its slow decay, but the Spanish
      Californians were sensible architects, and its massive walls and
      partitions defied the earthquake thrill, and all the year round kept an
      even temperature within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor led Miguel through a low anteroom into a plainly-furnished chamber,
      where Carmen sat painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Mistress Carmen was a bit of a painter, in a pretty little way, with
      all the vague longings of an artist, but without, I fear, the artist's
      steadfast soul. She recognized beauty and form as a child might, without
      understanding their meaning, and somehow failed to make them even
      interpret her woman's moods, which surely were nature's too. So she
      painted everything with this innocent lust of the eye,&mdash;flowers,
      birds, insects, landscapes, and figures,&mdash;with a joyous fidelity, but
      no particular poetry. The bird never sang to her but one song, the flowers
      or trees spake but one language, and her skies never brightened except in
      color. She came out strong on the Catholic saints, and would toss you up a
      cleanly-shaven Aloysius, sweetly destitute of expression, or a dropsical,
      lethargic Madonna that you couldn't have told from an old master, so bad
      it was. Her faculty of faithful reproduction even showed itself in
      fanciful lettering,&mdash;and latterly in the imitation of fabrics and
      signatures. Indeed, with her eye for beauty of form, she had always
      excelled in penmanship at the Convent,&mdash;an accomplishment which the
      good sisters held in great repute.
    </p>
    <p>
      In person she was petite, with a still unformed girlish figure, perhaps a
      little too flat across the back, and with possibly a too great tendency to
      a boyish stride in walking. Her brow, covered by blue-black hair, was low
      and frank and honest; her eyes, a very dark hazel, were not particularly
      large, but rather heavily freighted in their melancholy lids with sleeping
      passion; her nose was of that unimportant character which no man
      remembers; her mouth was small and straight; her teeth, white and regular.
      The whole expression of her face was piquancy that might be subdued by
      tenderness or made malevolent by anger. At present it was a salad in which
      the oil and vinegar were deftly combined. The astute feminine reader will
      of course understand that this is the ordinary superficial masculine
      criticism, and at once make up her mind both as to the character of the
      young lady and the competency of the critic. I only know that I rather
      liked her. And her functions are somewhat important in this veracious
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up, started to her feet, leveled her black brows at the
      intruder, but, at a sign from her uncle, showed her white teeth and spake.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a sentence, and a rather common-place one at that; but if she
      could have put her voice upon her canvas, she might have retrieved the
      Garcia fortunes. For it was so musical, so tender, so sympathizing, so
      melodious, so replete with the graciousness of womanhood, that she seemed
      to have invented the language. And yet that sentence was only an
      exaggerated form of the 'How d'ye do,' whined out, doled out, lisped out,
      or shot out from the pretty mouths of my fair countrywomen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel admired the paintings. He was struck particularly with a crayon
      drawing of a mule. "Mother of God, it is the mule itself! observe how it
      will not go." Then the crafty Victor broke in with, "But it is nothing to
      her writing; look, you shall tell to me which is the handwriting of Pio
      Pico;" and, from a drawer in the secretary, he drew forth two signatures.
      One was affixed to a yellowish paper, the other drawn on plain white
      foolscap. Of course Miguel took the more modern one with lover-like
      gallantry. "It is this is genuine!" Victor laughed triumphantly; Carmen
      echoed the laugh melodiously in child-like glee, and added, with a slight
      toss of her piquant head, "It is mine!" The best of the sex will not
      refuse a just and overdue compliment from even the man they dislike. It's
      the principle they're after, not the sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Victor was not satisfied with this proof of his niece's skill. "Say to
      her," he demanded of Miguel, "what name thou likest, and it shall be done
      before thee here." Miguel was not so much in love but he perceived the
      drift of Victor's suggestion, and remarked that the rubric of Governor
      Micheltorena was exceedingly complicated and difficult. "She shall do it!"
      responded Victor, with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a file of old departmental papers the Governor's signature and that
      involved rubric, which must have cost his late Excellency many youthful
      days of anxiety, was produced and laid before Carmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen took her pen in her hand, looked at the brownish-looking document,
      and then at the virgin whiteness of the foolscap before her. "But," she
      said, pouting prettily, "I should have to first paint this white paper
      brown. And it will absorb the ink more quickly than that. When I painted
      the San Antonio of the Mission San Gabriel for Father Acolti, I had to put
      the decay in with my oils and brushes before the good Padre would accept
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two scamps looked at each other. It was their supreme moment. "I think
      I have," said Victor, with assumed carelessness, "I think I have some of
      the old Custom-House paper." He produced from the secretary a sheet of
      brown paper with a stamp. "Try it on that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen smiled with childish delight, tried it, and produced a marvel! "It
      is as magic," said Miguel, feigning to cross himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor's role was more serious. He affected to be deeply touched, took the
      paper, folded it, and placed it in his breast. "I shall make a good fool
      of Don Jose Castro," he said; "he will declare it is the Governor's own
      signature, for he was his friend; but have a care, Carmen! that you spoil
      it not by the opening of your red lips. When he is fooled, I will tell him
      of this marvel,&mdash;this niece of mine, and he shall buy her pictures.
      Eh, little one?" and he gave her the avuncular caress, i. e., a pat of the
      hand on either cheek, and a kiss. Miguel envied him, but cupidity
      outgeneraled Cupid, and presently the conversation flagged, until a
      convenient recollection of Victor's&mdash;that himself and comrade were
      due at the Posada del Toros at 10 o'clock&mdash;gave them the opportunity
      to retire. But not without a chance shot from Carmen. "Tell to me," she
      said, half to Victor and half to Miguel, "what has chanced with Concho? He
      was ever ready to bring to me flowers from the mountain, and insects and
      birds. Thou knowest how he would sit, oh, my uncle, and talk to me of the
      rare rocks he had seen, and the bears and the evil spirits, and now he
      comes no longer, my Concho! How is this? Nothing evil has befallen him,
      surely?" and her drooping lids closed half-pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel's jealousy took fire. "He is drunk, Senorita, doubtless, and has
      forgotten not only thee but, mayhap, his mule and pack! It is his custom,
      ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The red died out of Carmen's ripe lips, and she shut them together with a
      snap like a steel purse. The dove had suddenly changed to a hawk; the
      child-girl into an antique virago; the spirit hitherto dimly outlined in
      her face, of some shrewish Garcia ancestress, came to the fore. She darted
      a quick look at her uncle, and then, with her little hands on her rigid
      lips, strode with two steps up to Miguel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly, O Senor Miguel Dominguez Perez (a profound courtesy here), it
      is as thou sayest. Drunkard Concho may be; but, drunk or sober, he never
      turned his back on his friend&mdash;or&mdash;(the words grated a little
      here)&mdash;his enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel would have replied, but Victor was ready. "Fool," he said, pinching
      his arm, "'tis an old friend. And&mdash;and&mdash;the application is still
      to be filled up. Are you crazy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But on this point Miguel was not, and with the revenge of a rival added to
      his other instincts, he permitted Victor to lead him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their return to the fonda, they found Master Manuel too far gone with
      aguardiente, and a general animosity to the average Americano, to be of
      any service. So they worked alone, with pen, ink, and paper, in the
      stuffy, cigarrito-clouded back room of the fonda. It was midnight, two
      hours after Concho had started, that Miguel clapped spurs to his horse for
      the village of Tres Pinos, with an application to Governor Micheltorena
      for a grant to the "Rancho of the Red Rocks" comfortably bestowed in his
      pocket.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHO PLEAD FOR IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      There can be little doubt the coroner's jury of Fresno would have returned
      a verdict of "death from alcoholism," as the result of their inquest into
      the cause of Concho's death, had not Dr. Guild fought nobly in support of
      the law and his own convictions. A majority of the jury objected to there
      being any inquest at all. A sincere juryman thought it hard that whenever
      a Greaser pegged out in a sneakin' kind o' way, American citizens should
      be taken from their business to find out what ailed him. "S'pose he was
      killed," said another, "thar ain't no time this thirty year he weren't, so
      to speak, just sufferin' for it, ez his nat'ral right ez a Mexican." The
      jury at last compromised by bringing in a verdict of homicide against
      certain parties unknown. Yet it was understood tacitly that these unknown
      parties were severally Wiles and Pedro; Manuel, Miguel, and Roscommon
      proving an unmistakable alibi. Wiles and Pedro had fled to lower
      California, and Manuel, Miguel, and Roscommon deemed it advisable, in the
      then excited state of the public mind, to withhold the forged application
      and claim from the courts and the public comment. So that for a year after
      the murder of Concho and the flight of his assassins "The Blue Mass Mining
      Company" remained in undisturbed and actual possession of the mine, and
      reigned in their stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the spirit of the murdered Concho would not down any more than that of
      the murdered Banquo, and so wrought, no doubt, in a quiet, Concho-like
      way, sore trouble with the "Blue Mass Company." For a great Capitalist and
      Master of Avarice came down to the mine and found it fair, and taking one
      of the Company aside, offered to lend his name and a certain amount of
      coin for a controlling interest, accompanying the generous offer with a
      suggestion that if it were not acceded to he would be compelled to buy up
      various Mexican mines and flood the market with quicksilver to the great
      detriment of the "Blue Mass Company," which thoughtful suggestion, offered
      by a man frequently alluded to as one of "California's great mining
      princes," and as one who had "done much to develop the resources of the
      State," was not to be lightly considered; and so, after a cautious
      non-consultation with the Company, and a commendable secrecy, the
      stockholder sold out. Whereat it was speedily spread abroad that the great
      Capitalist had taken hold of "Blue Mass," and the stock went up, and the
      other stockholders rejoiced&mdash;until the great Capitalist found that it
      was necessary to put up expensive mills, to employ a high salaried
      Superintendent, in fact, to develop the mine by the spending of its
      earnings, so that the stock quoted at 112 was finally saddled with an
      assessment of $50 per share. Another assessment of $50 to enable the
      Superintendent to proceed to Russia and Spain and examine into the
      workings of the quicksilver mines there, and also a general commission to
      the gifted and scientific Pillageman to examine into the various component
      parts of quicksilver, and report if it could not be manufactured from
      ordinary sand-stone by steam or electricity, speedily brought the other
      stockholders to their senses. It was at this time the good fellow "Tom,"
      the serious-minded "Dick," and the speculative but fortunate "Harry,"
      brokers of the Great Capitalist, found it convenient to buy up, for the
      Great Capitalist aforesaid, the various other shares at great sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fear that I have bored my readers in thus giving the tiresome details of
      that ingenuous American pastime which my countrymen dismiss in their
      epigrammatic way as the "freezing-out process." And lest any reader should
      question the ethics of the proceeding, I beg him to remember that one
      gentleman accomplished in this art was always a sincere and direct
      opponent of the late Mr. John Oakhurst, gambler.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for once the Great Master of Avarice had not taken into sufficient
      account the avarice of others, and was suddenly and virtuously shocked to
      learn that an application for a patent for certain lands, known as the
      "Red-Rock Rancho," was about to be offered before the United States Land
      Commission. This claim covered his mining property. But the information
      came quietly and secretly, as all of the Great Master's information was
      obtained, and he took the opportunity to sell out his clouded title and
      his proprietorship to the only remaining member of the original "Blue Mass
      Company," a young fellow of pith, before many-tongued rumor had voiced the
      news far and wide. The blow was a heavy one to the party left in
      possession. Saddled by the enormous debts and expenses of the Great
      Capitalist, with a credit now further injured by the defection of this
      lucky magnate, who was admired for his skill in anticipating a loss, and
      whose relinquishment of any project meant ruin to it, the single-handed,
      impoverished possessor of the mine, whose title was contested, and whose
      reputation was yet to be made,&mdash;poor Biggs, first secretary and only
      remaining officer of the "Blue Mass Company," looked ruefully over his
      books and his last transfer, and sighed. But I have before intimated that
      he was built of good stuff, and that he believed in his work,&mdash;which
      was well,&mdash;and in himself, which was better; and so, having faith
      even as a grain of mustard seed, I doubt not he would have been able to
      remove that mountain of quicksilver beyond the overlapping of fraudulent
      grants. And, again, Providence&mdash;having disposed of these several
      scamps&mdash;raised up to him a friend. But that friend is of sufficient
      importance to this veracious history to deserve a paragraph to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pylades of this Orestes was known of ordinary mortals as Royal
      Thatcher. His genealogy, birth, and education are, I take it, of little
      account to this chronicle, which is only concerned with his friendship for
      Biggs and the result thereof. He had known Biggs a year or two previously;
      they had shared each other's purses, bunks, cabins, provisions, and often
      friends, with that perfect freedom from obligation which belonged to the
      pioneer life. The varying tide of fortune had just then stranded Thatcher
      on a desert sand hill in San Francisco, with an uninsured cargo of
      Expectations, while to Thatcher's active but not curious fancy it had
      apparently lifted his friend's bark over the bar in the Monterey mountains
      into an open quicksilver sea. So that he was considerably surprised on
      receiving a note from Biggs to this purport:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR ROY&mdash;Run down here and help a fellow. I've too much of a load
      for one. Maybe we can make a team and pull 'Blue Mass' out yet. BIGGSEY."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher, sitting in his scantily furnished lodgings, doubtful of his next
      meal and in arrears for rent, heard this Macedonian cry as St. Paul did.
      He wrote a promissory and soothing note to his landlady, but fearing the
      "sweet sorrow" of personal parting, let his collapsed valise down from his
      window by a cord, and, by means of an economical combination of stage
      riding and pedestrianism, he presented himself, at the close of the third
      day, at Biggs's door. In a few moments he was in possession of the story;
      half an hour later in possession of half the mine, its infelix past and
      its doubtful future, equally with his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Business over, Biggs turned to look at his partner. "You've aged some
      since I saw you last," he said. "Starvation luck, I s'pose. I'd know your
      eyes, old fellow, if I saw them among ten thousand; but your lips are
      parched, and your mouth's grimmer than it used to be." Thatcher smiled to
      show that he could still do so, but did not say, as he might have said,
      that self-control, suppressed resentment, disappointment, and occasional
      hunger had done something in the way of correcting Nature's obvious
      mistakes, and shutting up a kindly mouth. He only took off his threadbare
      coat, rolled up his sleeves, and saying, "We've got lots of work and some
      fighting before us," pitched into the "affairs" of the "Blue Mass Company"
      on the instant.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      OF COUNSEL FOR IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Roscommon had waited. Then, in Garcia's name, and backed by him,
      he laid his case before the Land Commissioner, filing the application
      (with forged indorsements) to Governor Micheltorena, and alleging that the
      original grant was destroyed by fire. And why?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed there was a limit to Miss Carmen's imitative talent. Admirable
      as it was, it did not reach to the reproduction of that official seal,
      which would have been a necessary appendage to the Governor's grant. But
      there were letters written on stamped paper by Governor Micheltorena to
      himself, Garcia, and to Miguel, and to Manuel's father, all of which were
      duly signed by the sign manual and rubric of
      Mrs.-Governor-Micheltorena-Carmen-de-Haro. And then there was "parol"
      evidence, and plenty of it; witnesses who remembered everything about it,&mdash;namely,
      Manuel, Miguel, and the all-recollecting De Haro; here were details,
      poetical and suggestive; and Dame-Quicklyish, as when his late Excellency,
      sitting not "by a sea-coal fire," but with aguardiente and cigarros, had
      sworn to him, the ex-ecclesiastic Miguel, that he should grant, and had
      granted, Garcia's request. There were clouds of witnesses, conversations,
      letters, and records, glib and pat to the occasion. In brief, there was
      nothing wanted but the seal of his Excellency. The only copy of that was
      in the possession of a rival school of renaissant art and the restoration
      of antiques, then doing business before the Land Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet the claim was rejected! Having lately recommended two separate
      claimants to a patent for the same land, the Land Commission became
      cautious and conservative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roscommon was at first astounded, then indignant, and then warlike,&mdash;he
      was for an "appale to onst!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With the reader's previous knowledge of Roscommon's disposition this may
      seem somewhat inconsistent; but there are certain natures to whom
      litigation has all the excitement of gambling, and it should be borne in
      mind that this was his first lawsuit. So that his lawyer, Mr. Saponaceous
      Wood, found him in that belligerent mood to which counsel are obliged to
      hypocritically bring all the sophistries of their profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you have your right to an appeal, but calm yourself, my dear
      sir, and consider. The case was presented strongly, the evidence
      overwhelming on our side, but we happened to be fighting previous
      decisions of the Land Commission that had brought them into trouble; so
      that if Micheltorena had himself appeared in Court and testified to his
      giving you the grant, it would have made no difference,&mdash;no Spanish
      grant had a show then, nor will it have for the next six months. You see,
      my dear sir, the Government sent out one of its big Washington lawyers to
      look into this business, and he reported frauds, sir, frauds, in a
      majority of the Spanish claims. And why, sir? why? He was bought, sir,
      bought&mdash;body and soul&mdash;by the Ring!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And fwhot's the Ring?" asked his client sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Ring is&mdash;ahem! a combination of unprincipled but wealthy persons
      to defeat the ends of justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And sure, fwhot's the Ring to do wid me grant as that thaving Mexican
      gave me as the collatherals for the bourd he was owin' me? Eh, mind that
      now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Ring, my dear sir, is the other side. It is&mdash;ahem! always the
      Other Side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why the divel haven't we a Ring too? And ain't I payin' ye five
      hundred dollars,&mdash;and the divel of Ring ye have, at all, at all?
      Fwhot am I payin' ye fur, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That a judicious expenditure of money," began Mr. Wood, "outside of
      actual disbursements, may not be of infinite service to you I am not
      prepared to deny,&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look ye, Mr. Sappy Wood, it's the 'appale' I want, and the grant I'll
      have, more betoken as the old woman's har-rut and me own is set on it
      entoirely. Get me the land and I'll give ye the half of it,&mdash;and it's
      a bargain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my dear sir, there are some rules in our profession,&mdash;technical
      though they may be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The divel fly away wid yer profession. Sure is it better nor me own? If
      I've risked me provisions and me whisky, that cost me solid goold in
      Frisco, on that thafe Garcia's claim, bedad! the loikes of ye can risk yer
      law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Wood, with an awkward smile, "I suppose that a deed for one
      half, on the consideration of friendship, my dear sir, and a dollar in
      hand paid by me, might be reconcilable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now it's talkin' ye are. But who's the felly we're foighten, that's got
      the Ring?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear sir, it's the United States," said the lawyer with gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The States! the Government is it? And is't that ye're afeared of? Sure
      it's the Government that I fought in me own counthree, it was the
      Government that druv me to Ameriky, and is it now that I'm going back on
      me principles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your political sentiments do you great credit," began Mr. Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But fwhot's the Government to do wid the appale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Government," said Mr. Wood significantly, "will be represented by the
      District Attorney."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who's the spalpeen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rumored," said Mr. Wood, slowly, "that a new one is to be
      appointed. I, myself, have had some ambition that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      His client bent a pair of cunning but not over-wise grey eyes on his
      American lawyer. But he only said, "Ye have, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Wood, answering the look boldly; "and if I had the support of
      a number of your prominent countrymen, who are so powerful with ALL
      parties,&mdash;men like YOU, my dear sir,&mdash;why, I think you might in
      time become a conservative, at least more resigned to the Government."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lesser and the greater scamp looked at each other, and for a
      moment or two felt a warm, sympathetic, friendly emotion for each other,
      and quietly shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depend upon it there is a great deal more kindly human sympathy between
      two openly-confessed scamps than there is in that calm, respectable
      recognition that you and I, dear reader, exhibit when we happen to oppose
      each other with our respective virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And ye'll get the appale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he DID! And by a singular coincidence got the District Attorneyship
      also. And with a deed for one half of the "Red-Rock Rancho" in his pocket,
      sent a brother lawyer in court to appear for his client, the United
      States, as against HIMSELF, Roscommon, Garcia, et al. Wild horses could
      not have torn him from this noble resolution. There is an indescribable
      delicacy in the legal profession which we literary folk ought to imitate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The United States lost! Which meant ruin and destruction to the "Blue Mass
      Company," who had bought from a paternal and beneficent Government lands
      which didn't belong to it. The Mexican grant, of course, antedated the
      occupation of the mine by Concho, Wiles, Pedro, et al., as well as by the
      "Blue Mass Company," and the solitary partners, Biggs and Thatcher. More
      than that, it swallowed up their improvements. It made Biggs and Thatcher
      responsible to Garcia for all the money the Grand Master of Avarice had
      made out of it. Mr. District Attorney was apparently distressed, but
      resigned. Messrs. Biggs and Thatcher were really distressed and combative.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, to advance a few years in this chronicle, began real litigation
      with earnestness, vigor, courage, zeal, and belief on the part of Biggs
      and Thatcher, and technicalities, delay, equivocation, and a general
      Fabian-like policy on the part of Garcia, Roscommon, et al. Of all these
      tedious processes I note but one, which for originality and audacity of
      conception appears to me to indicate more clearly the temper and
      civilization of the epoch. A subordinate officer of the District Court
      refused to obey the mandate ordering a transcript of the record to be sent
      up to the United States Supreme Court. It is to be regretted that the name
      of this Ephesian youth, who thus fired the dome of our constitutional
      liberties, should have been otherwise so unimportant as to be confined to
      the dusty records of that doubtful court of which he was a doubtful
      servitor, and that his claim to immortality ceased with his double-feed
      service. But there still stands on record a letter by this young
      gentleman, arraigning the legal wisdom of the land, which is not entirely
      devoid of amusement or even instruction to young men desirous of obtaining
      publicity and capital. Howbeit, the Supreme Court was obliged to protect
      itself by procuring the legislation of his functions out of his local
      fingers into the larger palm of its own attorney.
    </p>
    <p>
      These various processes of law and equity, which, when exercised
      practically in the affairs of ordinary business, might have occupied a few
      months' time, dragged, clung, retrograded, or advanced slowly during a
      period of eight or nine years. But the strong arms of Biggs and Thatcher
      held POSSESSION, and possibly, by the same tactics employed on the other
      side, arrested or delayed ejectment, and so made and sold quicksilver,
      while their opponents were spending gold, until Biggs, sorely hit in the
      interlacings of his armor, fell in the lists, his cheek growing waxen and
      his strong arm feeble, and finding himself in this sore condition, and
      passing, as it were, made over his share in trust to his comrade, and
      died. Whereat, from that time henceforward, Royal Thatcher reigned in his
      stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, having anticipated the legal record, we will go back to the
      various human interests that helped to make it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin with Roscommon: To do justice to his later conduct and
      expressions, it must be remembered that when he accepted the claim for the
      "Red-Rock Rancho," yet unquestioned, from the hands of Garcia, he was
      careless, or at least unsuspicious of fraud. It was not until he had
      experienced the intoxication of litigation that he felt, somehow, that he
      was a wronged and defrauded man, but with the obstinacy of defrauded men,
      preferred to arraign some one fact or individual as the impelling cause of
      his wrong, rather than the various circumstances that led to it. To his
      simple mind it was made patent that the "Blue Mass Company" were making
      money out of a mine which he claimed, and which was not yet adjudged to
      them. Every dollar they took out was a fresh count in this general
      indictment. Every delay towards this adjustment of rights&mdash;although
      made by his own lawyer&mdash;was a personal wrong. The mere fact that
      there never was nor had been any quid pro quo for this immense property&mdash;that
      it had fallen to him for a mere song&mdash;only added zest to his
      struggle. The possibility of his losing this mere speculation affected him
      more strongly than if he had already paid down the million he expected to
      get from the mine. I don't know that I have indicated as plainly as I
      might that universal preference on the part of mankind to get something
      from nothing, and to acquire the largest return for the least possible
      expenditure, but I question my right to say that Roscommon was much more
      reprehensible than his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it told upon him as it did upon all over whom the spirit of the
      murdered Concho brooded,&mdash;upon all whom avarice alternately flattered
      and tortured. From his quiet gains in his legitimate business, from the
      little capital accumulated through industry and economy, he lavished
      thousands on this chimera of his fancy. He grew grizzled and worn over his
      self-imposed delusion; he no longer jested with his customers, regardless
      of quality or station or importance; he had cliques to mollify, enemies to
      placate, friends to reward. The grocery suffered; through giving food and
      lodgment to clouds of unimpeachable witnesses before the Land Commission
      and the District Court, "Mrs. Ros." found herself losing money. Even the
      bar failed; there was a party of "Blue Mass" employees who drank at the
      opposite fonda, and cursed the Roscommon claim over the liquor. The calm,
      mechanical indifference with which Roscommon had served his customers was
      gone. The towel was no longer used after its perfunctory fashion; the
      counter remained unwiped; the disks of countless glasses marked its
      surface, and indicated other preoccupation on the part of the proprietor.
      The keen grey eyes of the claimant of the "Red-Rock Rancho" were always on
      the lookout for friend or enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garcia comes next. That gentleman's inborn talent for historic
      misrepresentation culminated unpleasantly through a defective memory; a
      year or two after he had sworn in his application for the "Rancho," being
      engaged in another case, some trifling inconsistency was discovered in his
      statements, which had the effect of throwing the weight of evidence to the
      party who had paid him most, but was instantly detected by the weaker
      party. Garcia's preeminence as a witness, an expert and general historian
      began to decline. He was obliged to be corroborated, and this required a
      liberal outlay of his fee. With the loss of his credibility as a witness
      bad habits supervened. He was frequently drunk, he lost his position, he
      lost his house, and Carmen, removed to San Francisco, supported him with
      her brush.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this brings us once more to that pretty painter and innocent forger
      whose unconscious act bore such baleful fruit on the barren hill-sides of
      the "Red-Rock Rancho," and also to a later blossom of her life, that
      opened, however, in kindlier sunshine.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT THE FAIR HAD TO DO ABOUT IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The house that Royal Thatcher so informally quitted in his exodus to the
      promised land of Biggs was one of those oversized, under-calculated
      dwellings conceived and erected in the extravagance of the San Francisco
      builder's hopes, and occupied finally in his despair. Intended originally
      as the palace of some inchoate California Aladdin, it usually ended as a
      lodging house in which some helpless widow or hopeless spinster managed to
      combine respectability with the hard task of bread getting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher's landlady was one of the former class. She had unfortunately
      survived not only her husband but his property, and, living in some
      deserted chamber, had, after the fashion of the Italian nobility, let out
      the rest of the ruin. A tendency to dwell upon these facts gave her
      conversation a peculiar significance on the first of each month. Thatcher
      had noticed this with the sensitiveness of an impoverished gentleman. But
      when, a few days after her lodger's sudden disappearance, a note came from
      him containing a draft in noble excess of all arrears and charges, the
      widow's heart was lifted, and the rock smitten with the golden wand gushed
      beneficence that shone in a new gown for the widow and a new suit for
      "Johnny," her son, a new oil cloth in the hall, better service to the
      lodgers, and, let us be thankful, a kindlier consideration for the poor
      little black-eyed painter from Monterey, then dreadfully behind in her
      room rent. For, to tell the truth, the calls upon Miss De Haro's scant
      purse by her uncle had lately been frequent, perjury having declined in
      the Monterey market, through excessive and injudicious supply, until the
      line of demarcation between it and absolute verity was so finely drawn
      that Victor Garcia had remarked that "he might as well tell the truth at
      once and save his soul, since the devil was in the market."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Plodgitt, the landlady, could not resist the desire to acquaint
      Carmen De Haro with her good fortune. "He was always a friend of yours, my
      dear,&mdash;and I know him to be a gentleman that would never let a poor
      widow suffer; and see what he says about you!" Here she produced
      Thatcher's note and read: "Tell my little neighbor that I shall come back
      soon to carry her and her sketching tools off by force, and I shall not
      let her return until she has caught the black mountains and the red rocks
      she used to talk about, and put the 'Blue Mass' mill in the foreground of
      the picture I shall order."
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this, little one? Surely, Carmen, thou needst not blush at this,
      thy first grand offer. Holy Virgin! is it of a necessity that thou
      shouldst stick the wrong end of thy brush in thy mouth, and then drop it
      in thy lap? Or was it taught thee by the good Sisters at the convent to
      stride in that boyish fashion to the side of thy elders and snatch from
      their hands the missive thou wouldst read? More of this we would know, O
      Carmen,&mdash;smallest of brunettes,&mdash;speak, little one, even in
      thine own melodious speech, that I may commend thee and thy rare
      discretion to my own fair countrywomen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, neither the present chronicler nor Mistress Plodgitt got any further
      information from the prudent Carmen, and must fain speculate upon certain
      facts that were already known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Carmen's little room was opposite to Thatcher's, and once or
      twice, the doors being open, Thatcher had a glimpse across the passage of
      a black-haired and a sturdy, boyish little figure in a great blue apron,
      perched on a stool before an easel, and on the other hand, Carmen had
      often been conscious of the fumes of a tobacco pipe penetrating her
      cloistered seclusion, and had seen across the passage, vaguely enveloped
      in the same nicotine cloud, an American Olympian, in a rocking chair, with
      his feet on the mantel shelf. They had once or twice met on the staircase,
      on which occasion Thatcher had greeted her with a word or two of
      respectful yet half-humorous courtesy,&mdash;a courtesy which never really
      offends a true woman, although it often piques her self-aplomb by the
      slight assumption of superiority in the humorist. A woman is quick to
      recognize the fact that the great and more dangerous passions are always
      SERIOUS, and may be excused if in self-respect she is often induced to try
      if there be not somewhere under the skin of this laughing Mercutio the
      flesh and blood of a Romeo. Thatcher was by nature a defender and
      protector; weakness, and weakness alone, stirred the depths of his
      tenderness,&mdash;often, I fear, only through its half-humorous aspects,&mdash;and
      on this plane he was pleased to place women and children. I mention this
      fact for the benefit of the more youthful members of my species, and am
      satisfied that an unconditional surrender and the complete laying down at
      the feet of Beauty of all strong masculinity is a cheap Gallicism that is
      untranslatable to most women worthy the winning. For a woman MUST always
      look up to the man she truly loves,&mdash;even if she has to go down on
      her knees to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the masculine reader will infer from this that Carmen was in love
      with Thatcher; the more critical and analytical feminine eye will see
      nothing herein that might not have happened consistently with friendship.
      For Thatcher was no sentimentalist; he had hardly paid a compliment to the
      girl,&mdash;even in the unspoken but most delicate form of attention.
      There were days when his room door was closed; there were days succeeding
      these blanks when he met her as frankly and naturally as if he had seen
      her yesterday. Indeed, on those days following his flight the
      simple-minded Carmen, being aware&mdash;heaven knows how&mdash;that he had
      not opened his door during that period, and fearing sickness, sudden
      death, or perhaps suicide, by her appeals to the landlady, assisted
      unwittingly in discovering his flight and defection. As she was for a few
      moments as indignant as Mrs. Plodgitt, it is evident that she had but
      little sympathy with the delinquent. And besides, hitherto she had known
      only Concho, her earliest friend, and was true to his memory, as against
      all Americanos, whom she firmly believed to be his murderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she dismissed the offer and the man from her mind, and went back to her
      painting,&mdash;a fancy portrait of the good Padre Junipero Serra, a great
      missionary, who, haply for the integrity of his bones and character, died
      some hundred years before the Americans took possession of California. The
      picture was fair but unsaleable, and she began to think seriously of sign
      painting, which was then much more popular and marketable. An unfinished
      head of San Juan de Bautista, artificially framed in clouds, she disposed
      of to a prominent druggist for $50, where it did good service as
      exhibiting the effect of four bottles of "Jones's Freckle Eradicator," and
      in a pleasant and unobtrusive way revived the memory of the saint. Still,
      she felt weary and was growing despondent, and had a longing for the good
      Sisters and the blameless lethargy of conventual life, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came!
    </p>
    <p>
      But not as the Prince should come, on a white charger, to carry away this
      cruelly-abused and enchanted damsel. He was sunburned, he was bearded like
      "the pard"; he was a little careless as to his dress, and pre-occupied in
      his ways. But his mouth and eyes were the same; and when he repeated in
      his old frank, half-mischievous way the invitation of his letter, poor
      little Carmen could only hesitate and blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought struck him and sent the color to his face. Your gentleman born
      is always as modest as a woman. He ran down stairs, and seizing the
      widowed Plodgitt, said hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're just killing yourself here. Take a change. Come down to Monterey
      for a day or two with me, and bring miss De Haro with you for company."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady recognized the situation. Thatcher was now a man of vast
      possibilities. In all maternal daughters of Eve there is the slightest bit
      of the chaperone and match-maker. It is the last way of reviving the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      She consented, and Carmen De Haro could not well refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies found the "Blue Mass" mills very much as Thatcher had
      previously delivered it to them, "a trifle rough and mannish." But he made
      over to them the one tenement reserved for himself, and slept with his
      men, or more likely under the trees. At first Mrs. Plodgitt missed gas and
      running water, and these several conveniences of civilization, among which
      I fear may be mentioned sheets and pillow cases; but the balsam of the
      mountain air soothed her neuralgia and her temper. As for Carmen, she
      rioted in the unlimited license of her absolute freedom from conventional
      restraint and the indulgence of her child-like impulses. She scoured the
      ledges far and wide alone; she dipped into dark copses, and scrambled over
      sterile patches of chemisal, and came back laden with the spoil of buckeye
      blossoms, manzanita berries and laurel. But she would not make a sketch of
      the "Blue Mass Company's" mills on a Mercator's projection&mdash;something
      that could be afterwards lithographed or chromoed, with the mills turning
      out tons of quicksilver through the energies of a happy and picturesque
      assemblage of miners&mdash;even to please her padrone, Don Royal Thatcher.
      On the contrary, she made a study of the ruins of the crumbled and decayed
      red-rock furnace, with the black mountain above it, and the light of a
      dying camp fire shining upon it, and the dull-red excavations in the
      ledge. But even this did not satisfy her until she had made some
      alterations; and when she finally brought her finished study to Don Royal,
      she looked at him a little defiantly. Thatcher admired honestly, and then
      criticised a little humorously and dishonestly. "But couldn't you, for a
      consideration, put up a sign-board on that rock with the inscription,
      'Road to the Blue Mass Company's new mills to the right,' and combine
      business with art? That's the fault of you geniuses. But what's this
      blanketed figure doing here, lying before the furnace? You never saw one
      of my miners there,&mdash;and a Mexican, too, by his serape." "That,"
      quoth Mistress Carmen, coolly, "was put in to fill up the foreground,&mdash;I
      wanted something there to balance the picture." "But," continued Thatcher,
      dropping into unconscious admiration again, "it's drawn to the life. Tell
      me, Miss De Haro, before I ask the aid and counsel of Mrs. Plodgitt, who
      is my hated rival, and your lay figure and model?" "Oh," said Carmen, with
      a little sigh, "It's only poor Coucho." "And where is Concho?" (a little
      impatiently.) "He's dead, Don Royal." "Dead?" "Of a verity,&mdash;very
      dead,&mdash;murdered by your countrymen." "I see,&mdash;and you know him?"
      "He was my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But" (wickedly), "isn't this a rather ghastly advertisement&mdash;outside
      of an illustrated newspaper&mdash;of my property?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ghastly, Don Royal. Look you, he sleeps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay" (in Spanish), "as the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen (crossing herself hastily), "After the fashion of the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both feeling uncomfortable. Carmen was shivering. But, being a
      woman, and tactful, she recovered her head first. "It is a study for
      myself, Don Royal; I shall make you another."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she slipped away, as she thought, out of the subject and his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was mistaken; in the evening he renewed the conversation. Carmen
      began to fence, not from cowardice or deceit, as the masculine reader
      would readily infer, but from some wonderful feminine instinct that told
      her to be cautious. But he got from her the fact, to him before unknown,
      that she was the niece of his main antagonist, and, being a gentleman, so
      redoubled his attentions and his courtesy that Mrs. Plodgitt made up her
      mind that it was a foregone conclusion, and seriously reflected as to what
      she should wear on the momentous occasion. But that night poor Carmen
      cried herself to sleep, resolving that she would hereafter cast aside her
      wicked uncle for this good-hearted Americano, yet never once connected her
      innocent penmanship with the deadly feud between them. Women&mdash;the
      best of them&mdash;are strong as to collateral facts, swift of deduction,
      but vague as children are to the exact statement or recognition of
      premises. It is hardly necessary to say that Carmen had never thought of
      connecting any act of hers with the claims of her uncle, and the
      circumstance of the signature she had totally forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masculine reader will now understand Carmen's confusion and blushes,
      and believe himself an ass to have thought them a confession of original
      affection. The feminine reader will, by this time, become satisfied that
      the deceitful minx's sole idea was to gain the affections of Thatcher. And
      really I don't know who is right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless she painted a sketch of Thatcher,&mdash;which now adorns the
      Company's office in San Francisco,&mdash;in which the property is laid out
      in pleasing geometrical lines, and the rosy promise of the future instinct
      in every touch of the brush. Then, having earned her "wage," as she
      believed, she became somewhat cold and shy to Thatcher. Whereat that
      gentleman redoubled his attentions, seeing only in her presence a certain
      meprise, which concerned her more than himself. The niece of his enemy
      meant nothing more to him than an interesting girl,&mdash;to be protected
      always,&mdash;to be feared, never. But even suspicion may be insidiously
      placed in noble minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Plodgitt, thus early estopped of matchmaking, of course put the
      blame on her own sex, and went over to the stronger side&mdash;the man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a great pity gals should be so curious," she said, sotto voce, to
      Thatcher, when Carmen was in one of her sullen moods. "Yet I s'pose it's
      in her blood. Them Spaniards is always revengeful,&mdash;like the
      Eyetalians."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher honestly looked his surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, don't you see, she's thinking how all these lands might have been
      her uncle's but for you. And instead of trying to be sweet and&mdash;"
      here she stopped to cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God!" said Thatcher in great concern, "I never thought of that." He
      stopped for a moment, and then added with decision, "I can't believe it;
      it isn't like her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. P. was piqued. She walked away, delivering, however, this Parthian
      arrow: "Well, I hope 'TAINT NOTHING WORSE."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher chuckled, then felt uneasy. When he next met Carmen, she found
      his grey eyes fixed on hers with a curious, half-inquisitorial look she
      had never noticed before. This only added fuel to the fire. Forgetting
      their relations of host and guest, she was absolutely rude. Thatcher was
      quiet but watchful; got the Plodgitt to bed early, and, under cover of
      showing a moonlight view of the "Lost Chance Mill," decoyed Carmen out of
      ear-shot, as far as the dismantled furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, Miss De Haro; have I offended you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Carmen was not aware that anything was the matter. If Don Royal
      preferred old friends, whose loyalty of course he knew, and who were above
      speaking ill against a gentleman in his adversity&mdash;(oh, Carmen! fie!)
      if he preferred THEIR company to LATER FRIENDS&mdash;why&mdash;(the
      masculine reader will observe this tremendous climax and tremble)&mdash;why
      she didn't know why HE should blame HER.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned and faced each other. The conditions for a perfect
      misunderstanding could not have been better arranged between two people.
      Thatcher was a masculine reasoner, Carmen a feminine feeler,&mdash;if I
      may be pardoned the expression. Thatcher wanted to get at certain facts,
      and argue therefrom. Carmen wanted to get at certain feelings, and then
      fit the facts to THEM.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am NOT blaming you, Miss Carmen," he said gravely. "It WAS stupid
      in me to confront you here with the property claimed by your uncle and
      occupied by me, but it was a mistake,&mdash;no!" he added hastily, "it was
      not a mistake. You knew it, and I didn't. You overlooked it before you
      came, and I was too glad to overlook it after you were here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Carmen pettishly, "I am the only one to be blamed. It's
      like you MEN!" (Mem. She was just fifteen, and uttered this awful 'resume'
      of experience just as if it hadn't been taught to her in her cradle.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Feminine generalities always stagger a man. Thatcher said nothing. Carmen
      became more enraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you want to take Uncle Victor's property, then?" she asked
      triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that it is your uncle's property."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You&mdash;don't&mdash;know? Have you seen the application with Governor
      Micheltorena's indorsement? Have you heard the witnesses?" she said
      passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signatures may be forged and witnesses lie," said Thatcher quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you call 'forged'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher instantly recalled the fact that the Spanish language held no
      synonym for "forgery." The act was apparently an invention of el Diablo
      Americano. So he said, with a slight smile in his kindly eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anybody wicked enough and dexterous enough can imitate another's
      handwriting. When this is used to benefit fraud, we call it 'forgery.' I
      beg your pardon,&mdash;Miss De Haro, Miss Carmen,&mdash;what is the
      matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had suddenly lapsed against a tree, quite helpless, nerveless, and
      with staring eyes fixed on his. As yet an embryo woman, inexperienced and
      ignorant, the sex's instinct was potential; she had in one plunge fathomed
      all that his reason had been years groping for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher saw only that she was pained, that she was helpless: that was
      enough. "It is possible that your uncle may have been deceived," he began;
      "many honest men have been fooled by clever but deceitful tricksters, men
      and women&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop! Madre de Dios! WILL YOU STOP?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher for an instant recoiled from the flashing eyes and white face of
      the little figure that had, with menacing and clenched baby fingers,
      strode to his side. He stopped. "Where is this application,&mdash;this
      forgery?" she asked. "Show it to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher felt relieved, and smiled the superior smile of our sex over
      feminine ignorance. "You could hardly expect me to be trusted with your
      uncle's vouchers. His papers of course are in the hands of his counsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when can I leave this place?" she asked passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you consult my wishes you will stay, if only long enough to forgive
      me. But if I have offended you unknowingly, and you are implacable&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can go to-morrow at sunrise if I like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you will," returned Thatcher gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracias, Senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked slowly back to the house, Thatcher with a masculine sense of
      being unreasonably afflicted, Carmen with a woman's instinct of being
      hopelessly crushed. No word was spoken until they reached the door. Then
      Carmen suddenly, in her old, impulsive way, and in a childlike treble,
      sang out merrily, "Good night, O Don Royal, and pleasant dreams. Hasta
      manana."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher stood dumb and astounded at this capricious girl. She saw his
      mystification instantly. "It is for the old Cat!" she whispered, jerking
      her thumb over her shoulder in the direction of the sleeping Mrs. P. "Good
      night,&mdash;go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to give orders for a peon to attend the ladies and their equipage
      the next day. He awoke to find Miss De Haro gone, with her escort, towards
      Monterey. And without the Plodgitt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not conceal his surprise from the latter lady. She, left alone,&mdash;a
      not altogether unavailable victim to the wiles of our sex,&mdash;was
      embarrassed. But not so much that she could not say to Thatcher: "I told
      you so,&mdash;gone to her uncle. . . . To tell him ALL!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All. D&mdash;n it, WHAT can she tell him?" roared Thatcher, stung out of
      his self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, I hope, that she should not," said Mrs. P., and chastely
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was right. Miss Carmen posted to Monterey, running her horse nearly
      off its legs to do it, and then sent back her beast and escort, saying she
      would rejoin Mrs. Plodgitt by steamer at San Francisco. Then she went
      boldly to the law office of Saponaceous Wood, District Attorney and whilom
      solicitor of her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the majority of masculine Monterey Miss Carmen was known and
      respectfully admired, despite the infelix reputation of her kinsman. Mr.
      Wood was glad to see her, and awkwardly gallant. Miss Carmen was cool and
      business-like; she had come from her uncle to "regard" the papers in the
      "Red-Rock Rancho" case. They were instantly produced. Carmen turned to the
      application for the grant. Her cheek paled slightly. With her clear memory
      and wonderful fidelity of perception she could not be mistaken. THE
      SIGNATURE OF MICHELTORENA WAS IN HER OWN HANDWRITING!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she looked up to the lawyer with a smile: "May I take these papers for
      an hour to my uncle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Even an older and better man than the District Attorney could not have
      resisted those drooping lids and that gentle voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will return them in an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as good as her word, and within the hour dropped the papers and a
      little courtesy to her uncle's legal advocate, and that night took the
      steamer to San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Victor Garcia, a little the worse for the previous
      night's dissipation, reeled into Wood's office. "I have fears for my niece
      Carmen. She is with the enemy," he said thickly. "Look you at this."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an anonymous letter (in Mrs. Plodgitt's own awkward fist) advising
      him of the fact that his niece was bought by the enemy, and cautioning him
      against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible," said the lawyer; "it was only last week she sent thee $50."
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor blushed, even through his ensanguined cheeks, and made an impatient
      gesture with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," added the lawyer coolly, "she has been here to examine the
      papers at thy request, and returned them of yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Victor gasped: "And-you-you-gave them to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All? Even the application and the signature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly,&mdash;you sent her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sent her? The devil's own daughter?" shrieked Garcia. "No! A hundred
      million times, no! Quick, before it is too late. Give to me the papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wood reproduced the file. Garcia ran over it with trembling fingers
      until at last he clutched the fateful document. Not content with opening
      it and glancing at its text and signature, he took it to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the same," he muttered with a sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it is," said Mr. Wood sharply. "The papers are all there.
      You're a fool, Victor Garcia!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he was. And, for the matter of that, so was Mr. Saponaceous Wood,
      of counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Miss De Haro returned to San Francisco and resumed her work. A
      day or two later she was joined by her landlady. Mrs. P. had too large a
      nature to permit an anonymous letter, written by her own hand, to stand
      between her and her demeanor to her little lodger. So she coddled her and
      flattered her and depicted in slightly exaggerated colors the grief of Don
      Royal at her sudden departure. All of which Miss Carmen received in a
      demure, kitten-like way, but still kept quietly at her work. In due time
      Don Royal's order was completed; still she had leisure and inclination
      enough to add certain touches to her ghastly sketch of the crumbling
      furnace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, as Don Royal did not return, through excess of business,
      Mrs. Plodgitt turned an honest penny by letting his room, temporarily, to
      two quiet Mexicans, who, but for a beastly habit of cigarrito smoking
      which tainted the whole house, were fair enough lodgers. If they failed in
      making the acquaintance of their fair countrywoman, Miss De Haro, it was
      through the lady's pre-occupation in her own work, and not through their
      ostentatious endeavors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss De Haro is peculiar," explained the politic Mrs. Plodgitt to her
      guests; "she makes no acquaintances, which I consider bad for her
      business. If it had not been for me, she would not have known Royal
      Thatcher, the great quicksilver miner,&mdash;and had his order for a
      picture of his mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The two foreign gentlemen exchanged glances. One said, "Ah, God! this is
      bad," and the other, "It is not possible;" and then, when the landlady's
      back was turned, introduced themselves with a skeleton key into the then
      vacant bedroom and studio of their fair countrywoman, who was absent
      sketching. "Thou observest," said Mr. Pedro, refugee, to Miguel,
      ex-ecclesiastic, "that this Americano is all-powerful, and that this
      Victor, drunkard as he is, is right in his suspicions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of a verity, yes," replied Miguel, "thou dost remember it was Jovita
      Castro who, for her Americano lover, betrayed the Sobriente claim. It is
      only with us, my Pedro, that the Mexican spirit, the real God and Liberty,
      yet lives!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands nobly and with sentimental fervor, and then went to work,
      i. e., the rummaging over the trunks, drawers, and portmanteaus of the
      poor little painter, Carmen de Haro, and even ripped up the mattress of
      her virginal cot. But they found not what they sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that yonder on the easel, covered with a cloth?" said Miguel: "it
      is a trick of these artists to put their valuables together."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pedro strode to the easel and tore away the muslin curtain that veiled it;
      then uttered a shriek that appalled his comrade and brought him to his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the name of God," said Miguel hastily, "are you trying to alarm the
      house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The ex-vaquero was trembling like a child. "Look," he said hoarsely,
      "look, do you see? It is the hand of God," and fainted on the floor!
    </p>
    <p>
      Miguel looked. It was Carmen's partly-finished sketch of the deserted
      furnace. The figure of Concho, thrown out strongly by the camp fire,
      occupied the left foreground. But to balance her picture she had evidently
      been obliged to introduce another,&mdash;the face and figure of Pedro, on
      all fours, creeping towards the sleeping man.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHO LOBBIED FOR IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a midsummer's day in Washington. Even at early morning, while the
      sun was yet level with the faces of pedestrians in its broad, shadeless
      avenues, it was insufferably hot. Later the avenues themselves shone like
      the diverging rays of another sun,&mdash;the Capitol,&mdash;a thing to be
      feared by the naked eye. Later yet it grew hotter, and then a mist arose
      from the Potomac, and blotted out the blazing arch above, and presently
      piled up along the horizon delusive thunder clouds, that spent their
      strength and substance elsewhere, and left it hotter than before. Towards
      evening the sun came out invigorated, having cleared the heavenly brow of
      perspiration, but leaving its fever unabated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The city was deserted. The few who remained apparently buried themselves
      from the garish light of day in some dim, cloistered recess of shop,
      hotel, or restaurant; and the perspiring stranger, dazed by the outer
      glare, who broke in upon their quiet, sequestered repose, confronted
      collarless and coatless specters of the past, with fans in their hands,
      who, after dreamily going through some perfunctory business, immediately
      retired to sleep after the stranger had gone. Congressmen and Senators had
      long since returned to their several constituencies with the various
      information that the country was going to ruin, or that the outlook never
      was more hopeful and cheering, as the tastes of their constituency
      indicated. A few Cabinet officers still lingered, having by this time
      become convinced that they could do nothing their own way, or indeed in
      any way but the old way, and getting gloomily resigned to their situation.
      A body of learned, cultivated men, representing the highest legal tribunal
      in the land, still lingered in a vague idea of earning the scant salary
      bestowed upon them by the economical founders of the Government, and
      listened patiently to the arguments of counsel, whose fees for advocacy of
      claims before them would have paid the life income of half the bench.
      There was Mr. Attorney-General and his assistants still protecting the
      Government's millions from rapacious hands, and drawing the yearly public
      pittance that their wealthier private antagonists would have scarce given
      as a retainer to their junior counsel. The little standing army of
      departmental employes,&mdash;the helpless victims of the most senseless
      and idiotic form of discipline the world has known,&mdash;a discipline so
      made up of caprice, expediency, cowardice, and tyranny that its reform
      meant revolution, not to be tolerated by legislators and lawgivers, or a
      despotism in which half a dozen accidentally-chosen men interpreted their
      prejudices or preferences as being that Reform. Administration after
      administration and Party after Party had persisted in their desperate
      attempts to fit the youthful colonial garments, made by our Fathers after
      a by-gone fashion, over the expanded limits and generous outline of a
      matured nation. There were patches here and there; there were grievous
      rents and holes here and there; there were ludicrous and painful exposures
      of growing limbs everywhere; and the Party in Power and the Party out of
      Power could do nothing but mend and patch, and revamp and cleanse and
      scour, and occasionally, in the wildness of despair, suggest even the
      cutting off the rebellious limbs that persisted in growing beyond the
      swaddling clothes of its infancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a capital of Contradictions and Inconsistencies. At one end of the
      Avenue sat the responsible High Keeper of the military honor, valor, and
      war-like prestige of a great nation, without the power to pay his own
      troops their legal dues until some selfish quarrel between Party and Party
      was settled. Hard by sat another Secretary, whose established functions
      seemed to be the misrepresentation of the nation abroad by the least
      characteristic of its classes, the politicians,&mdash;and only then when
      they had been defeated as politicians, and when their constituents had
      declared them no longer worthy to be even THEIR representatives. This
      National Absurdity was only equaled by another, wherein an ex-Politician
      was for four years expected to uphold the honor of a flag of a great
      nation over an ocean he had never tempted, with a discipline the rudiments
      of which he could scarcely acquire before he was removed, or his term of
      office expired, receiving his orders from a superior officer as ignorant
      of his special duties as himself, and subjected to the revision of a
      Congress cognizant of him only as a politician. At the farther end of the
      Avenue was another department so vast in its extent and so varied in its
      functions that few of the really great practical workers of the land would
      have accepted its responsibility for ten times its salary, but which the
      most perfect constitution in the world handed over to men who were obliged
      to make it a stepping stone to future preferment. There was another
      department, more suggestive of its financial functions from the occasional
      extravagances or economies exhibited in its payrolls,&mdash;successive
      Congresses having taken other matters out of its hands,&mdash;presided
      over by an official who bore the title and responsibility of the Custodian
      and Disburser of the Nation's Purse, and received a salary that a
      bank-President would have sniffed at. For it was part of this
      Constitutional Inconsistency and Administrative Absurdity that in the
      matter of honor, justice, fidelity to trust, and even business integrity,
      the official was always expected to be the superior of the Government he
      represented. Yet the crowning Inconsistency was that, from time to time,
      it was submitted to the sovereign people to declare if these various
      Inconsistencies were not really the perfect expression of the most perfect
      Government the world had known. And it is to be recorded that the
      unanimous voices of Representative, Orator, and Unfettered Poetry were
      that it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the public press lent itself to the Great Inconsistency. It was as
      clear as crystal to the journal on one side of the Avenue that the country
      was going to the dogs unless the SPIRIT of the Fathers once more
      reanimated the public; it was equally clear to the journal on the other
      side of the Avenue that only a rigid adherence to the LETTER of the
      Fathers would save the nation from decline. It was obvious to the
      first-named journal that the "letter" meant Government patronage to the
      other journal; it was patent to that journal that the "shekels" of Senator
      X really animated the spirit of the Fathers. Yet all agreed it was a great
      and good and perfect government,&mdash;subject only to the predatory
      incursions of a Hydra-headed monster known as a "Ring." The Ring's origin
      was wrapped in secrecy, its fecundity was alarming; but although its
      rapacity was preternatural, its digestion was perfect and easy. It
      circumvolved all affairs in an atmosphere of mystery; it clouded all
      things with the dust and ashes of distrust. All disappointment of place,
      of avarice, of incompetency or ambition, was clearly attributable to it.
      It even permeated private and social life; there were Rings in our kitchen
      and household service; in our public schools, that kept the active
      intelligences of our children passive; there were Rings of engaging,
      handsome, dissolute young fellows, who kept us moral but unengaging
      seniors from the favors of the fair; there were subtle, conspiring Rings
      among our creditors, which sent us into bankruptcy and restricted our
      credit. In fact it would not be hazardous to say that all that was
      calamitous in public and private experience was clearly traceable to that
      combination of power in a minority over weakness in a majority&mdash;known
      as a Ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haply there was a body of demigods, as yet uninvoked, who should speedily
      settle all that. When Smith of Minnesota, Robinson of Vermont, and Jones
      of Georgia returned to Congress from these rural seclusions so potent with
      information and so freed from local prejudices, it was understood,
      vaguely, that great things would be done. This was always understood.
      There never was a time in the history of American politics when, to use
      the expression of the journals before alluded to, "the present session of
      Congress" did not "bid fair to be the most momentous in our history," and
      did not, as far as the facts go, leave a vast amount of unfinished
      important business lying hopelessly upon its desks, having "bolted" the
      rest as rashly and with as little regard to digestion or assimilation as
      the American traveller has for his railway refreshment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this capital, on this languid midsummer day, in an upper room of one of
      its second-rate hotels, the Honorable Pratt C. Gashwiler sat at his
      writing-table. There are certain large, fleshy men with whom the omission
      of even a necktie or collar has all the effect of an indecent exposure.
      The Hon. Mr. Gashwiler, in his trousers and shirt, was a sight to be
      avoided by the modest eye. There were such palpable suggestions of vast
      extents of unctuous flesh in the slight glimpse offered by his open throat
      that his dishabille should have been as private as his business.
      Nevertheless, when there was a knock at his door he unhesitatingly said,
      "Come in!"&mdash;pushing away a goblet crowned with a certain aromatic
      herb with his right hand, while he drew towards him with his left a few
      proof slips of his forthcoming speech. The Gashwiler brow became, as it
      were, intelligently abstracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intruder regarded Gashwiler with a glance of familiar recognition from
      his right eye, while his left took in a rapid survey of the papers on the
      table, and gleamed sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are at work, I see," he said apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied the Congressman, with an air of perfunctory weariness,&mdash;"one
      of my speeches. Those d&mdash;&mdash;d printers make such a mess of it; I
      suppose I don't write a very fine hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the gifted Gashwiler had added that he did not write a very intelligent
      hand, or a very grammatical hand, and that his spelling was faulty, he
      would have been truthful, although the copy and proof before him might not
      have borne him out. The near fact was that the speech was composed and
      written by one Expectant Dobbs, a poor retainer of Gashwiler, and the
      honorable member's labor as a proof-reader was confined to the
      introduction of such words as "anarchy," "oligarchy," "satrap,"
      "palladium," and "Argus-eyed" in the proof, with little relevancy as to
      position or place, and no perceptible effect as to argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger saw all this with his wicked left eye, but continued to beam
      mildly with his right. Removing the coat and waistcoat of Gashwiler from a
      chair, he drew it towards the table, pushing aside a portly, loud-ticking
      watch,&mdash;the very image of Gashwiler,&mdash;that lay beside him, and,
      resting his elbows on the proofs, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you anything new?" asked the parliamentary Gashwiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much! a woman!" replied the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The astute Gashwiler, waiting further information, concluded to receive
      this fact gaily and gallantly. "A woman?&mdash;my dear Mr. Wiles,&mdash;of
      course! The dear creatures," he continued, with a fat, offensive chuckle,
      "somehow are always making their charming presence felt. Ha! ha! A man,
      sir, in public life becomes accustomed to that sort of thing, and knows
      when he must be agreeable,&mdash;agreeable, sir, but firm! I've had my
      experience, sir,&mdash;my OWN experience,"&mdash;and the Congressman
      leaned back in his chair, not unlike a robust St. Anthony who had
      withstood one temptation to thrive on another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Wiles impatiently, "but d&mdash;n it, she's on the OTHER
      SIDE."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other side!" repeated Gashwiler vacantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she's a niece of Garcia's. A little she devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Garcia's on our side," rejoined Gashwiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but she is bought by the Ring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman!" sneered Mr. Gashwiler; "what can she do with men who won't be
      made fools of? Is she so handsome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw any great beauty in her," said Wiles shortly, "although they
      say that she's rather caught that d&mdash;&mdash;d Thatcher, in spite of
      his coldness. At any rate, she is his protegee. But she isn't the sort
      you're thinking of, Gashwiler. They say she knows, or pretends to know,
      something about the grant. She may have got hold of some of her uncle's
      papers. Those Greasers were always d&mdash;&mdash;d fools; and, if he did
      anything foolish, like as not he bungled or didn't cover up his tracks.
      And with his knowledge and facilities too! Why, if I'd&mdash;" but here
      Mr. Wiles stopped to sigh over the inequalities of fortune that wasted
      opportunities on the less skillful scamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler became dignified. "She can do nothing with us," he said
      potentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles turned his wicked eye on him. "Manuel and Miguel, who sold out to
      our man, are afraid of her. They were our witnesses. I verily believe
      they'd take back everything if she got after them. And as for Pedro, he
      thinks she holds the power of life and death over him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pedro! life and death,&mdash;what's all this?" said the astonished
      Gashwiler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles saw his blunder, but saw also that he had gone too far to stop.
      "Pedro," he said, "was strongly suspected of having murdered Concho, one
      of the original locators."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler turned white as a sheet, and then flushed again into an
      apoplectic glow. "Do you dare to say," he began as soon as he could find
      his tongue and his legs, for in the exercise of his congressional
      functions these extreme members supported each other,&mdash;"do you mean
      to say," he stammered in rising rage, "that you have dared to deceive an
      American lawgiver into legislating upon a measure connected with a capital
      offense? Do I understand you to say, sir, that murder stands upon the
      record&mdash;stands upon the record, sir,&mdash;of this cause to which, as
      a representative of Remus, I have lent my official aid? Do you mean to say
      that you have deceived my constituency, whose sacred trust I hold, in
      inveigling me to hiding a crime from the Argus eyes of justice?" And Mr.
      Gashwiler looked towards the bell-pull as if about to summon a servant to
      witness this outrage against the established judiciary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The murder, if it WAS a murder, took place before Garcia entered upon
      this claim, or had a footing in this court," returned Wiles blandly, "and
      is no part of the record."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sure it is not spread upon the record?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. You can judge for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler walked to the window, returned to the table, finished his
      liquor in a single gulp, and then, with a slight resumption of dignity,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That alters the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles glanced with his left eye at the Congressman. The right placidly
      looked out of the window. Presently he said quietly, "I've brought you the
      certificates of stock; do you wish them made out in your own name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler tried hard to look as if he were trying to recall the
      meaning of Wiles's words. "Oh!&mdash;ah!&mdash;umph!&mdash;let me see,&mdash;oh,
      yes, the certificates,&mdash;certainly! Of course you will make them out
      in the name of my secretary, Mr. Expectant Dobbs. They will perhaps repay
      him for the extra clerical labor required in the prosecution of your
      claim. He is a worthy young man. Although not a public officer, yet he is
      so near to me that perhaps I am wrong in permitting him to accept a fee
      for private interests. An American representative cannot be too cautious,
      Mr. Wiles. Perhaps you had better have also a blank transfer. The stock
      is, I understand, yet in the future. Mr. Dobbs, though talented and
      praiseworthy, is poor; he may wish to realize. If some&mdash;ahem! some
      FRIEND&mdash;better circumstanced should choose to advance the cash to him
      and run the risk,&mdash;why, it would only be an act of kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are proverbially generous, Mr. Gashwiler," said Wiles, opening and
      shutting his left eye like a dark lantern on the benevolent
      representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Youth, when faithful and painstaking, should be encouraged," replied Mr.
      Gashwiler. "I lately had occasion to point this out in a few remarks I had
      to make before the Sabbath school reunion at Remus. Thank you, I will see
      that they are&mdash;ahem!&mdash;conveyed to him. I shall give them to him
      with my own hand," he concluded, falling back in his chair, as if the
      better to contemplate the perspective of his own generosity and
      condescension. Mr. Wiles took his hat and turned to go. Before he reached
      the door Mr. Gashwiler returned to the social level with a chuckle:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say this woman, this Garcia's niece, is handsome and smart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can set another woman on the track that'll euchre her every time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wiles was too clever to appear to notice the sudden lapse in the
      Congressman's dignity, and only said, with his right eye:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By G-d, I WILL, or I don't know how to represent Remus."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wiles thanked him with his right eye, and looked a dagger with his
      left. "Good," he said, and added persuasively: "Does she live here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Congressman nodded assent. "An awfully handsome woman,&mdash;a
      particular friend of mine!" Mr. Gashwiler here looked as if he would not
      mind to have been rallied a little over his intimacy with the fair one;
      but the astute Mr. Wiles was at the same moment making up his mind, after
      interpreting the Congressman's look and manner, that he must know this
      fair incognita if he wished to sway Gashwiler. He determined to bide his
      time, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was scarcely closed upon him when another knock diverted Mr.
      Gashwiler's attention from his proofs. The door opened to a young man with
      sandy hair and anxious face. He entered the room deprecatingly, as if
      conscious of the presence of a powerful being, to be supplicated and
      feared. Mr. Gashwiler did not attempt to disabuse his mind. "Busy, you
      see," he said shortly, "correcting your work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope it is acceptable?" said the young man timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;yes&mdash;it will do," said Gashwiler; "indeed I may say it is
      satisfactory on the whole," he added with the appearance of a large
      generosity; "quite satisfactory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no news, I suppose," continued the young man, with a slight
      flush, born of pride or expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nothing as yet." Mr. Gashwiler paused as if a thought had struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have thought," he said, finally, "that some position&mdash;such as a
      secretaryship with me&mdash;would help you to a better appointment. Now,
      supposing that I make you my private secretary, giving you some important
      and confidential business. Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dobbs looked at his patron with a certain wistful, dog-like expectancy,
      moved himself excitedly on his chair seat in a peculiar canine-like
      anticipation of gratitude, strongly suggesting that he would have wagged
      his tail if he had one. At which Mr. Gashwiler became more impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I may say I anticipated it by certain papers I have put in your
      charge and in your name, only taking from you a transfer that might enable
      me to satisfy my conscience hereafter in recommending you as my&mdash;ahem!&mdash;private
      secretary. Perhaps, as a mere form, you might now, while you are here, put
      your name to these transfers, and, so to speak, begin your duties at
      once."
    </p>
    <p>
      The glow of pride and hope that mantled the cheek of poor Dobbs might have
      melted a harder heart than Gashwiler's. But the senatorial toga had
      invested Mr. Gashwiler with a more than Roman stoicism towards the
      feelings of others, and he only fell back in his chair in the pose of
      conscious rectitude as Dobbs hurriedly signed the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall place them in my portman-tell," said Gashwiler, suiting the word
      to the action, "for safe keeping. I need not inform you, who are now, as
      it were, on the threshold of official life, that perfect and inviolable
      secrecy in all affairs of State"&mdash;Mr. G. here motioned toward his
      portmanteau as if it contained a treaty at least&mdash;"is most essential
      and necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dobbs assented. "Then my duties will keep me with you here?" he asked
      doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Gashwiler hastily; then, correcting himself, he added:
      "that is&mdash;for the present&mdash;no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Dobbs's face fell. The near fact was that he had lately had notice to
      quit his present lodgings in consequence of arrears in his rent, and he
      had a hopeful reliance that his confidential occupation would carry bread
      and lodging with it. But he only asked if there were any new papers to
      make out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ahem! not at present; the fact is I am obliged to give so much of my time
      to callers&mdash;I have to-day been obliged to see half a dozen&mdash;that
      I must lock myself up and say 'Not at home' for the rest of the day."
      Feeling that this was an intimation that the interview was over, the new
      private secretary, a little dashed as to his near hopes, but still
      sanguine of the future, humbly took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here a certain Providence, perhaps mindful of poor Dobbs, threw into
      his simple hands&mdash;to be used or not, if he were worthy or capable of
      using it&mdash;a certain power and advantage. He had descended the
      staircase, and was passing through the lower corridor, when he was made
      the unwilling witness of a remarkable assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that Mr. Wiles, who had quitted Gashwiler's presence as Dobbs
      was announced, had other business in the hotel, and in pursuance of it had
      knocked at room No. 90. In response to the gruff voice that bade him
      enter, Mr. Wiles opened the door, and espied the figure of a tall,
      muscular, fiery-bearded man extended on the bed, with the bedclothes
      carefully tucked under his chin, and his arms lying flat by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wiles beamed with his right cheek, and advanced to the bed as if to
      take the hand of the stranger, who, however, neither by word or sign
      responded to his salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps I'm intruding?" said Mr. Wiles blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you are," said Red Beard dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wiles forced a smile on his right cheek, which he turned to the
      smiter, but permitted the left to indulge in unlimited malevolence. "I
      wanted merely to know if you have looked into that matter?" he said
      meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've looked into it and round it and across it and over it and through
      it," responded the man gravely, with his eyes fixed on Wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have perused all the papers?" continued Mr. Wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've read every paper, every speech, every affidavit, every decision,
      every argument," said the stranger as if repeating a formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wiles attempted to conceal his embarrassment by an easy, right-handed
      smile, that went off sardonically on the left, and continued: "Then I
      hope, my dear sir, that, having thoroughly mastered the case, you are
      inclined to be favorable to us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman in the bed did not reply, but apparently nestled more
      closely beneath the coverlids.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have brought the shares I spoke of," continued Mr. Wiles,
      insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hev you a friend within call?" interrupted the recumbent man gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite understand!" smiled Mr. Wiles. "Of course any name you
      might suggest&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hev you a friend, any chap that you might waltz in here at a moment's
      call?" continued the man in bed. "No? Do you know any of them waiters in
      the house? Thar's a bell over yan!" and he motioned with his eyes towards
      the wall, but did not otherwise move his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Wiles, becoming slightly suspicious and wrathful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mebbe a stranger might do? I reckon thar's one passin' in the hall. Call
      him in,&mdash;he'll do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Wiles opened the door a little impatiently, yet inquisitively, as Dobbs
      passed. The man in bed called out, "Oh, stranger!" and, as Dobbs stopped,
      said, "Come yar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dobbs entered a little timidly, as was his habit with strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know who you be&mdash;nor care, I reckon," said the stranger.
      "This yer man"&mdash;pointing to Wiles&mdash;"is Wiles. I'm Josh Sibblee
      of Fresno, Member of Congress from the 4th Congressional District of
      Californy. I'm jist lying here, with a derringer into each hand,&mdash;jist
      lying here kivered up and holdin' in on'y to keep from blowin' the top o'
      this d&mdash;&mdash;d skunk's head off. I kinder feel I can't hold in any
      longer. What I want to say to ye, stranger, is that this yer skunk&mdash;which
      his name is Wiles&mdash;hez bin tryin' his d&mdash;dest to get a bribe
      onto Josh, and Josh, outo respect for his constituents, is jist waitin'
      for some stranger to waltz in and stop the d&mdash;dest fight&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear Mr. Sibblee, there must be some mistake," said Wiles
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mistake? Strip me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! No!" said Wiles, hurriedly, as the simple-minded Dobbs was about to
      draw down the coverlid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him away," said the Hon. Mr. Sibblee, "before I disgrace my
      constituency. They said I'd be in jail afore I get through the session. Ef
      you've got any humanity, stranger, snake him out, and pow'ful quick, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dobbs, quite white and aghast, looked at Wiles and hesitated. There was a
      slight movement in the bed. Both men started for the door; and the next
      minute it closed very decidedly on the member from Fresno.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW IT WAS LOBBIED FOR
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Hon. Pratt C. Gashwiler, M.C., was of course unaware of the incident
      described in the last chapter. His secret, even if it had been discovered
      by Dobbs, was safe in that gentleman's innocent and honorable hands, and
      certainly was not of a quality that Mr. Wiles, at present, would have
      cared to expose. For, in spite of Mr. Wiles's discomfiture, he still had
      enough experience of character to know that the irate member from Fresno
      would be satisfied with his own peculiar manner of vindicating his own
      personal integrity, and would not make a public scandal of it. Again,
      Wiles was convinced that Dobbs was equally implicated with Gashwiler, and
      would be silent for his own sake. So that poor Dobbs, as is too often the
      fate of simple but weak natures, had full credit for duplicity by every
      rascal in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      From which it may be inferred that nothing occurred to disturb the
      security of Gashwiler. When the door closed upon Mr. Wiles, he indited a
      note which, with a costly but exceedingly distasteful bouquet,&mdash;rearranged
      by his own fat fingers, and discord and incongruity visible in every
      combination of color,&mdash;he sent off by a special messenger. Then he
      proceeded to make his toilet,&mdash;an operation rarely graceful or
      picturesque in our sex, and an insult to the spectator when obesity is
      superadded. When he had put on a clean shirt, of which there was grossly
      too much, and added a white waistcoat, that seemed to accent his
      rotundity, he completed his attire with a black frock coat of the latest
      style, and surveyed himself complacently before a mirror. It is to be
      recorded that, however satisfactory the result might have been to Mr.
      Gashwiler, it was not so to the disinterested spectator. There are some
      men on whom "that deformed thief, Fashion," avenges himself by making
      their clothes appear perennially new. The gloss of the tailor's iron never
      disappears; the creases of the shelf perpetually rise in judgment against
      the wearer. Novelty was the general suggestion of Mr. Gashwiler's
      full-dress,&mdash;it was never his HABITUDE;&mdash;and "Our own Make,"
      "Nobby," and the "Latest Style, only $15," was as patent on the
      legislator's broad back as if it still retained the shop-man's ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus arrayed, within an hour he complacently followed the note and his
      floral offering. The house he sought had been once the residence of a
      foreign Ambassador, who had loyally represented his government in a single
      unimportant treaty, now forgotten, and in various receptions and dinners,
      still actively remembered by occasional visits to its salon; now the
      average dreary American parlor. "Dear me," the fascinating Mr. X would
      say, "but do you know, love, in this very room I remember meeting the
      distinguished Marquis of Monte Pio;" or perhaps the fashionable Jones of
      the State Department instantly crushed the decayed friend he was
      perfunctorily visiting by saying, "'Pon my soul, YOU here;&mdash;why, the
      last time I was in this room I gossiped for an hour with the Countess de
      Castenet in that very corner." For, with the recall of the aforesaid
      Ambassador, the mansion had become a boarding-place, kept by the wife of a
      departmental clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there was nothing in the history of the house more quaint and
      philosophic than the story of its present occupant. Roger Fauquier had
      been a departmental clerk for forty years. It was at once his practical
      good luck and his misfortune to have been early appointed to a position
      which required a thorough and complete knowledge of the formulas and
      routine of a department that expended millions of the public funds.
      Fauquier, on a poor salary, diminishing instead of increasing with his
      service, had seen successive administrations bud and blossom and decay,
      but had kept his position through the fact that his knowledge was a
      necessity to the successive chiefs and employes. Once it was true that he
      had been summarily removed by a new Secretary, to make room for a camp
      follower, whose exhaustive and intellectual services in a political
      campaign had made him eminently fit for anything; but the alarming
      discovery that the new clerk's knowledge of grammar and etymology was even
      worse than that of the Secretary himself, and that, through ignorance of
      detail, the business of that department was retarded to a damage to the
      Government of over half a million of dollars, led to the reinstatement of
      Mr. Fauquier&mdash;AT A LOWER SALARY. For it was felt that something was
      wrong somewhere, and as it had always been the custom of Congress and the
      administration to cut down salaries as the first step to reform, they made
      of Mr. Fauquier a moral example. A gentleman born, of somewhat expensive
      tastes, having lived up to his former salary, this change brought another
      bread-winner into the field, Mrs. Fauquier, who tried, more or less
      unsuccessfully, to turn her old Southern habits of hospitality to
      remunerative account. But as poor Fauquier could never be prevailed upon
      to present a bill to a gentleman, sir, and as some of the scions of the
      best Southern families were still waiting for, or had been recently
      dismissed from, a position, the experiment was a pecuniary failure. Yet
      the house was of excellent repute and well patronized; indeed, it was
      worth something to see old Fauquier sitting at the head of his own table,
      in something of his ancestral style, relating anecdotes of great men now
      dead and gone, interrupted only by occasional visits from importunate
      tradesmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prominent among what Mr. Fauquier called his "little family" was a
      black-eyed lady of great powers of fascination, and considerable local
      reputation as a flirt. Nevertheless, these social aberrations were amply
      condoned by a facile and complacent husband, who looked with a lenient and
      even admiring eye upon the little lady's amusement, and to a certain
      extent lent a tacit indorsement to her conduct. Nobody minded Hopkinson;
      in the blaze of Mrs. Hopkinson's fascinations he was completely lost sight
      of. A few married women with unduly sensitive husbands, and several single
      ladies of the best and longest standing, reflected severely on her
      conduct. The younger men of course admired her, but I think she got her
      chief support from old fogies like ourselves. For it is your quiet,
      self-conceited, complacent, philosophic, broad-waisted paterfamilias who,
      after all, is the one to whom the gay and giddy of the proverbially
      impulsive, unselfish sex owe their place in the social firmament. We are
      never inclined to be captious; we laugh at as a folly what our wives and
      daughters condemn as a fault; OUR "withers are unwrung," yet we still
      confess to the fascinations of a pretty face. We know, bless us, from dear
      experience, the exact value of one woman's opinion of another; we want our
      brilliant little friend to shine; it is only the moths who will burn their
      two-penny immature wings in the flame! And why should they not? Nature has
      been pleased to supply more moths than candles! Go to!&mdash;give the
      pretty creature&mdash;be she maid, wife, or widow&mdash;a show! And so, my
      dear sir, while mater-familias bends her black brows in disgust, we smile
      our superior little smile, and extend to Mistress Anonyma our gracious
      indorsement. And if giddiness is grateful, or if folly is friendly,&mdash;well,
      of course, we can't help that. Indeed it rather proves our theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had intended to say something about Hopkinson; but really there is very
      little to say. He was invariably good humored. A few ladies once tried to
      show him that he really ought to feel worse than he did about the conduct
      of his wife; and it is recorded that Hopkinson, in an excess of good humor
      and kindliness, promised to do so. Indeed the good fellow was so
      accessible that it is said that young DeLancy of the Tape Department
      confided to Hopkinson his jealousy of a rival; and revealed the awful
      secret that he (DeLancy) had reason to expect more loyalty from his
      (Hopkinson's) wife. The good fellow is reported to have been very
      sympathetic, and to have promised Delaney to lend whatever influence he
      had with Mrs. Hopkinson in his favor. "You see," he said explanatorily to
      DeLancy, "she has a good deal to attend to lately, and I suppose has got
      rather careless,&mdash;that's women's ways. But if I can't bring her round
      I'll speak to Gashwiler,&mdash;I'll get him to use his influence with Mrs.
      Hop. So cheer up, my boy, HE'LL make it all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of a bouquet on the table of Mrs. Hopkinson was no rare
      event; nevertheless, Mr. Gashwiler's was not there. Its hideous contrasts
      had offended her woman's eye,&mdash;it is observable that good taste
      survives the wreck of all the other feminine virtues,&mdash;and she had
      distributed it to make boutonnieres for other gentlemen. Yet, when he
      appeared, she said to him hastily, putting her little hand over the
      cardiac region:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so glad you came. But you gave me SUCH a fright an hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler was both pleased and astounded. "What have I done, my dear
      Mrs. Hopkinson?" he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't talk," she said sadly. "What have you done, indeed! Why, you
      sent me that beautiful bouquet. I could not mistake your taste in the
      arrangement of the flowers;&mdash;but my husband was here. You know his
      jealousy. I was obliged to conceal it from him. Never&mdash;promise me now&mdash;NEVER
      do it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler gallantly protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I am serious! I was so agitated: he must have seen me blush."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing but the gross flattery to this speech could have clouded its
      manifest absurdity to the Gashwiler consciousness. But Mr. Gashwiler had
      already succumbed to the girlish half-timidity with which it was uttered.
      Nevertheless, he could not help saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should he be so jealous now? Only day before yesterday I saw
      Simpson of Duluth hand you a nosegay right before him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," returned the lady, "he was outwardly calm THEN, but you know nothing
      of the scene that occurred between us after you left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," gasped the practical Gashwiler, "Simpson had given your husband
      that contract,&mdash;a cool fifty thousand in his pocket!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hopkinson looked as dignifiedly at Gashwiler as was consistent with
      five feet three (the extra three inches being a pyramidal structure of
      straw-colored hair), a frond of faint curls, a pair of laughing blue eyes,
      and a small belted waist. Then she said, with a casting down of her lids:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget that my husband loves me." And for once the minx appeared to
      look penitent. It was becoming; but as it had been originally practiced in
      a simple white dress, relieved only with pale-blue ribbons, it was not
      entirely in keeping with be-flounced lavender and rose-colored trimmings.
      Yet the woman who hesitates between her moral expression and the harmony
      of her dress is lost. And Mrs. Hopkinson was victrix by her very audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler was flattered. The most dissolute man likes the appearance
      of virtue. "But graces and accomplishments like yours, dear Mrs.
      Hopkinson," he said oleaginously, "belong to the whole country." Which,
      with something between a courtesy and a strut, he endeavored to represent.
      "And I shall want to avail myself of all," he added, "in the matter of the
      Castro claim. A little supper at Welcker's, a glass or two of champagne,
      and a single flash of those bright eyes, and the thing is done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Mrs. Hopkinson, "I've promised Josiah that I would give up all
      those frivolities, and although my conscience is clear, you know how
      people talk! Josiah hears it. Why, only last night, at a reception at the
      Patagonian Minister's, every woman in the room gossiped about me because I
      led the german with him. As if a married woman, whose husband was
      interested in the Government, could not be civil to the representative of
      a friendly power?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler did not see how Mr. Hopkinson's late contract for supplying
      salt pork and canned provisions to the army of the United States should
      make his wife susceptible to the advances of foreign princes; but he
      prudently kept that to himself. Still, not being himself a diplomat, he
      could not help saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I understood that Mr. Hopkinson did not object to your interesting
      yourself in this claim, and you know some of the stock&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady started, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stock! Dear Mr. Gashwiler, for Heaven's sake don't mention that hideous
      name to me. Stock, I am sick of it! Have you gentlemen no other topic for
      a lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She punctuated her sentence with a mischievous look at her interlocutor.
      For a second time I regret to say that Mr. Gashwiler succumbed. The Roman
      constituency at Remus, it is to be hoped, were happily ignorant of this
      last defection of their great legislator. Mr. Gashwiler instantly forgot
      his theme,&mdash;began to ply the lady with a certain bovine-like
      gallantry, which it is to be said to her credit she parried with a
      playful, terrier-like dexterity, when the servant suddenly announced, "Mr.
      Wiles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gashwiler started. Not so Mrs. Hopkinson, who, however, prudently and
      quietly removed her own chair several inches from Gashwiler's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know Mr. Wiles?" she asked pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! That is, I&mdash;ah&mdash;yes, I may say I have had some business
      relations with him," responded Gashwiler rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you stay?" she added pleadingly. "Do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler's prudence always got the better of his gallantry. "Not
      now," he responded in some nervousness. "Perhaps I had better go now, in
      view of what you have just said about gossip. You need not mention my name
      to this-er&mdash;this&mdash;Mr. Wiles." And with one eye on the door, and
      an awkward dash of his lips at the lady's fingers, he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no introductory formula to Mr. Wiles's interview. He dashed at
      once in medias res. "Gashwiler knows a woman that, he says, can help us
      against that Spanish girl who is coming here with proofs, prettiness,
      fascination, and what not! You must find her out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked the lady laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I don't trust that Gashwiler. A woman with a pretty face and an
      ounce of brains could sell him out; aye, and US with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, say TWO ounces of brains. Mr. Wiles, Mr. Gashwiler is no fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly, except when your sex is concerned, and it is very likely that
      the woman is his superior."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so," said Mrs. Hopkinson with a mischievous look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you know her, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so well as I know him," said Mrs. H. quite seriously. "I wish I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you'll find out if she's to be trusted! You are laughing,&mdash;it
      is a serious matter! This woman&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hopkinson dropped him a charming courtesy and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "C'est moi!"

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A RACE FOR IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      Royal Thatcher worked hard. That the boyish little painter who shared his
      hospitality at the "Blue Mass" mine should afterward have little part in
      his active life seemed not inconsistent with his habits. At present the
      mine was his only mistress, claiming his entire time, exasperating him
      with fickleness, but still requiring that supreme devotion of which his
      nature was capable. It is possible that Miss Carmen saw this too, and so
      set about with feminine tact, if not to supplement, at least to make her
      rival less pertinacious and absorbing. Apart from this object, she
      zealously labored in her profession, yet with small pecuniary result, I
      fear. Local art was at a discount in California. The scenery of the
      country had not yet become famous; rather it was reserved for a certain
      Eastern artist, already famous, to make it so; and people cared little for
      the reproduction, under their very noses, of that which they saw
      continually with their own eyes, and valued not. So that little Mistress
      Carmen was fain to divert her artist soul to support her plump little
      material body; and made divers excursions into the regions of ceramic art,
      painting on velvet, illuminating missals, decorating china, and the like.
      I have in my possession some wax flowers&mdash;a startling fuchsia and a
      bewildering dahlia&mdash;sold for a mere pittance by this little lady,
      whose pictures lately took the prize at a foreign exhibition, shortly
      after she had been half starved by a California public, and claimed by a
      California press as its fostered child of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these struggles and triumphs Thatcher had no knowledge; yet he was
      perhaps more startled than he would own to himself when, one December day,
      he received this despatch: "Come to Washington at once.&mdash;Carmen de
      Haro."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carmen de Haro!" I grieve to state that such was the preoccupation of
      this man, elected by fate to be the hero of the solitary amatory episode
      of his story, that for a moment he could not recall her. When the honest
      little figure that had so manfully stood up against him, and had proved
      her sex by afterwards running away from him, came back at last to his
      memory, he was at first mystified and then self-reproachful. He had been,
      he felt vaguely, untrue to himself. He had been remiss to the
      self-confessed daughter of his enemy. Yet why should she telegraph to him,
      and what was she doing in Washington? To all these speculations it is to
      be said to his credit that he looked for no sentimental or romantic
      answer. Royal Thatcher was naturally modest and self-depreciating in his
      relations to the other sex, as indeed most men who are apt to be
      successful with women generally are, despite a vast degree of
      superannuated bosh to the contrary. To the half dozen women who are
      startled by sheer audacity into submission there are scores who are piqued
      by a self-respectful patience; and where a women has to do half the
      wooing, she generally makes a pretty sure thing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his bewilderment Thatcher had overlooked a letter lying on his table.
      It was from his Washington lawyer. The concluding paragraph caught his
      eye,&mdash;"Perhaps it would be well if you came here yourself. Roscommon
      is here; and they say there is a niece of Garcia's, lately appeared, who
      is likely to get up a strong social sympathy for the old Mexican. I don't
      know that they expect to prove anything by her; but I'm told she is
      attractive and clever, and has enlisted the sympathies of the delegation."
      Thatcher laid the letter down a little indignantly. Strong men are quite
      as liable as weak women are to sudden inconsistencies on any question they
      may have in common. What right had this poor little bud he had cherished,&mdash;he
      was quite satisfied now that he had cherished her, and really had suffered
      from her absence,&mdash;what right had she to suddenly blossom in the
      sunshine of power to be, perhaps, plucked and worn by one of his enemies?
      He did not agree with his lawyer that she was in any way connected with
      his enemies: he trusted to her masculine loyalty that far. But here was
      something vaguely dangerous to the feminine mind,&mdash;position,
      flattery, power. He was almost as firmly satisfied now that he had been
      wronged and neglected as he had been positive a few moments before that he
      had been remiss in his attention. The irritation, although momentary, was
      enough to decide this strong man. He telegraphed to San Francisco; and,
      having missed the steamer, secured an overland passage to Washington;
      thought better of it, and partly changed his mind an hour after the ticket
      was purchased; but, manlike, having once made a practical step in a wrong
      direction, he kept on rather than admit an inconsistency to himself. Yet
      he was not entirely satisfied that his journey was a business one. The
      impulsive, weak little Mistress Carmen had prudently scored one against
      the strong man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a small part of the present great trans-continental railway at this
      time had been built, and was but piers at either end of a desolate and
      wild expanse as yet unbridged. When the overland traveller left the rail
      at Reno, he left, as it were, civilization with it; and, until he reached
      the Nebraska frontier, the rest of his road was only the old emigrant
      trail traversed by the coaches of the Overland Company. Excepting a part
      of "Devil's Canyon," the way was unpicturesque and flat; and the passage
      of the Rocky Mountains, far from suggesting the alleged poetry of that
      region, was only a reminder of those sterile distances of a level New
      England landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The journey was a dreary monotony that was scarcely enlivened by its
      discomforts, never amounting to actual accident or incident, but utterly
      destructive to all nervous tissue. Insanity often supervened. "On the
      third day out," said Hank Monk, driver, speaking casually but charitably
      of a "fare,"&mdash;"on the third day out, after axing no end of questions
      and getting no answers, he took to chewing straws that he picked outer the
      cushion, and kussin' to hisself. From that very day I knew it was all over
      with him, and I handed him over to his friends at 'Shy Ann,' strapped to
      the back seat, and ravin' and cussin' at Ben Holliday, the gent'manly
      proprietor." It is presumed that the unfortunate tourist's indignation was
      excited at the late Mr. Benjamin Holliday, then the proprietor of the
      line,&mdash;an evidence of his insanity that no one who knew that
      large-hearted, fastidious, and elegantly-cultured Californian, since
      allied to foreign nobility, will for a moment doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Royal Thatcher was too old and experienced a mountaineer to do aught
      but accept patiently and cynically his brother Californian's method of
      increasing his profits. As it was generally understood that any one who
      came from California by that route had some dark design, the victim
      received little sympathy. Thatcher's equable temperament and indomitable
      will stood him in good stead, and helped him cheerfully in this emergency.
      He ate his scant meals, and otherwise took care of the functions of his
      weak human nature, when and where he could, without grumbling, and at
      times earned even the praise of his driver by his ability to "rough it."
      Which "roughing it," by the way, meant the ability of the passengers to
      accept the incompetency of the Company. It is true there were times when
      he regretted that he had not taken the steamer; but then he reflected that
      he was one of a Vigilance Committee, sworn to hang that admirable man, the
      late Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, for certain practices and cruelties
      done upon the bodies of certain steerage passengers by his line, and for
      divers irregularities in their transportation. I mention this fact merely
      to show how so practical and stout a voyager as Thatcher might have
      confounded the perplexities attending the administration of a great
      steamship company with selfish greed and brutality; and that he, with
      other Californians, may not have known the fact, since recorded by the
      Commodore's family clergyman, that the great millionaire was always true
      to the hymns of his childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Thatcher found time to be cheerful and helpful to his fellow
      passengers, and even to be so far interesting to "Yuba Bill," the driver,
      as to have the box seat placed at his disposal. "But," said Thatcher, in
      some concern, "the box seat was purchased by that other gentleman in
      Sacramento. He paid extra for it, and his name's on your way-bill!"
      "That," said Yuba Bill, scornfully, "don't fetch me even ef he'd chartered
      the whole shebang. Look yar, do you reckon I'm goin' to spile my temper by
      setting next to a man with a game eye? And such an eye! Gewhillikins! Why,
      darn my skin, the other day when we war watering at Webster's, he got down
      and passed in front of the off-leader,&mdash;that yer pinto colt that's
      bin accustomed to injins, grizzlies, and buffalo, and I'm bless ef, when
      her eye tackled his, ef she didn't jist git up and rar round that I
      reckoned I'd hev to go down and take them blinders off from HER eyes and
      clap on HIS." "But he paid the money, and is entitled to his seat,"
      persisted Thatcher. "Mebbe he is&mdash;in the office of the Kempeny,"
      growled Yuba Bill; "but it's time some folks knowed that out in the plains
      I run this yer team myself."&mdash;A fact which was self-evident to most
      of the passengers. "I suppose his authority is as absolute on this dreary
      waste as a ship captain's in mid ocean," exclaimed Thatcher to the
      baleful-eyed stranger. Mr. Wiles&mdash;whom the reader has recognized&mdash;assented
      with the public side of his face, but looked vengeance at Yuba Bill with
      the other, while Thatcher, innocent of the presence of one of his worst
      enemies, placated Bill so far as to restore Wiles to his rights. Wiles
      thanked him. "Shall I have the pleasure of your company far?" Wiles asked
      insinuatingly. "To Washington," replied Thatcher frankly. "Washington is a
      gay city during the session," again suggested the stranger. "I'm going on
      business," said Thatcher bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trifling incident occurred at Pine-Tree Crossing which did not heighten
      Yuba Bill's admiration of the stranger. As Bill opened the double-locked
      box in the "boot" of the coach&mdash;sacred to Wells, Fargo &amp; Co.'s
      Express and the Overland Company's treasures&mdash;Mr. Wiles perceived a
      small, black morocco portemanteau among the parcels. "Ah, you carry
      baggage there too?" he said sweetly. "Not often," responded Yuba Bill
      shortly. "Ah, this then contains valuables?" "It belongs to that man whose
      seat you've got," said Yuba Bill, who, for insulting purposes of his own,
      preferred to establish the fiction that Wiles was an interloper; "and ef
      he reckons, in a sorter mixed kempeny like this, to lock up his
      portmantle, I don't know who's business it is. Who?" continued Bill,
      lashing himself into a simulated rage, "who, in blank, is running this yer
      team? Hey? Mebbe you think, sittin' up thar on the box seat, you are.
      Mebbe you think you kin see round corners with that thar eye, and kin pull
      up for teams round corners, on down grades, a mile ahead?" But here
      Thatcher, who, with something of Lancelot's concern for Modred, had a
      noble pity for all infirmities, interfered so sternly that Yuba Bill
      stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day they struck a blinding snow-storm, while ascending the
      dreary plateau that henceforward for six hundred miles was to be their
      roadbed. The horses, after floundering through the drift, gave out
      completely on reaching the next station, and the prospects ahead, to all
      but the experienced eye, looked doubtful. A few passengers advised taking
      to sledges, others a postponement of the journey until the weather
      changed. Yuba Bill alone was for pressing forward as they were. "Two miles
      more and we're on the high grade, whar the wind is strong enough to blow
      you through the windy, and jist peart enough to pack away over them cliffs
      every inch of snow that falls. I'll jist skirmish round in and out o' them
      drifts on these four wheels whar ye can't drag one o' them flat-bottomed
      dry-goods boxes through a drift." Bill had a California whip's contempt
      for a sledge. But he was warmly seconded by Thatcher, who had the next
      best thing to experience, the instinct that taught him to read character,
      and take advantage of another man's experience. "Them that wants to stop
      kin do so," said Bill authoritatively, cutting the Gordian knot; "them as
      wants to take a sledge can do so,&mdash;thar's one in the barn. Them as
      wants to go on with me and the relay will come on." Mr. Wiles selected the
      sledge and a driver, a few remained for the next stage, and Thatcher, with
      two others, decided to accompany Yuba Bill. These changes took up some
      valuable time; and the storm continuing, the stage was run under the shed,
      the passengers gathering around the station fire; and not until after
      midnight did Yuba Bill put in the relays. "I wish you a good journey,"
      said Wiles, as he drove from the shed as Bill entered. Bill vouchsafed no
      reply, but, addressing himself to the driver, said curtly, as if giving an
      order for the delivery of goods, "Shove him out at Rawlings," and passed
      contemptuously around to the tail board of the sled, and returned to the
      harnessing of his relay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon came out and shone high as Yuba Bill once more took the reins in
      his hands. The wind, which instantly attacked them as they reached the
      level, seemed to make the driver's theory plausible, and for half a mile
      the roadbed was swept clean, and frozen hard. Further on a tongue of snow,
      extending from a boulder to the right, reached across their path to the
      height of two or three feet. But Yuba Bill dashed through a part of it,
      and by skillful maneuvering circumvented the rest. But even as the
      obstacle was passed, the coach dropped with an ominous lurch on one side,
      and the off fore wheel flew off in the darkness. Bill threw the horses
      back on their haunches; but, before their momentum could be checked, the
      near hind wheel slipped away, the vehicle rocked violently, plunged
      backwards and forwards, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuba Bill was on the road in an instant with his lantern. Then followed an
      outbreak of profanity which I regret, for artistic purposes, exceeds that
      generous limit which a sympathizing public has already extended to me in
      the explication of character. Let me state, therefore, that in a very few
      moments he succeeded in disparaging the characters of his employers, their
      male and female relatives, the coach builder, the station keeper, the road
      on which he travelled, and the travellers themselves, with occasional
      broad expletives addressed to himself and his own relatives. For the
      spirit of this and a more cultivated poetry of expression, I beg to refer
      the temperate reader to the 3d chapter of Job.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers knew Bill, and sat, conservative, patient, and expectant.
      As yet the cause of the catastrophe was not known. At last Thatcher's
      voice came from the box seat:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's up, Bill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a blank lynch pin in the whole blank coach," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dead silence. Yuba Bill executed a wild war dance of helpless
      rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blank the blank ENCHANTED thing to blank!"
    </p>
    <p>
      (I beg here to refer the fastidious and cultivated reader to the only
      adjective I have dared transcribe of this actual oath which I once had the
      honor of hearing. He will I trust not fail to recognize the old classic
      daemon in this wild western objurgation.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who did it?" asked Thatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuba Bill did not reply, but dashed up again to the box, unlocked the
      "boot," and screamed out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man that stole your portmantle,&mdash;Wiles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher laughed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry about that, Bill. A 'biled' shirt, an extra collar, and a few
      papers. Nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuba Bill slowly descended. When he reached the ground, he plucked
      Thatcher aside by his coat sleeve:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye don't mean to say ye had nothing in that bag ye was trying to get away
      with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the laughing Thatcher frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that Wiles warn't one o' them detectives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not to my knowledge, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuba Bill sighed sadly, and returned to assist in the replacing of the
      coach on its wheels again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, Bill," said one of the passengers sympathizingly, "we'll
      catch that man Wiles at Rawlings sure;" and he looked around at the
      inchoate vigilance committee, already "rounding into form" about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ketch him!" returned Yuba Bill, derisively, "why we've got to go back to
      the station; and afore we're off agin he's pinted fur Clarmont on the
      relay we lose. Ketch him! H-ll's full of such ketches!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was clearly nothing to do but to go back to the station to await the
      repairing of the coach. While this was being done Yuba Bill again drew
      Thatcher aside:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I allers suspected that chap's game eye, but I didn't somehow allow for
      anything like this. I reckoned it was only the square thing to look arter
      things gen'rally, and 'specially your traps. So, to purvent troubil, and
      keep things about ekal, ez he was goin' away, I sorter lifted this yer bag
      of hiz outer the tail board of his sleigh. I don't know as it is any
      exchange or compensation, but it may give ye a chance to spot him agin, or
      him you. It strikes me as bein' far-minded and squar';" and with these
      words he deposited at the feet of the astounded Thatcher the black
      travelling bag of Mr. Wiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Bill,&mdash;see here! I can't take this!" interrupted Thatcher
      hastily. "You can't swear that he's taken my bag,&mdash;and&mdash;and,&mdash;blank
      it all,&mdash;this won't do, you know. I've no right to this man's things,
      even if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your hosses," said Bill gravely; "I ondertook to take charge o' your
      traps. I didn't&mdash;at least that d&mdash;&mdash;d wall-eyed&mdash;Thar's
      a portmantle! I don't know who's it is. Take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Half amused, half embarrassed, yet still protesting, Thatcher took the bag
      in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye might open it in my presence," suggested Yuba Bill gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher, half laughingly, did so. It was full of papers and
      semi-legal-looking documents. Thatcher's own name on one of them caught
      his eye; he opened the paper hastily and perused it. The smile faded from
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Yuba Bill, "suppose we call it a fair exchange at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher was still examining the papers. Suddenly this cautious,
      strong-minded man looked up into Yuba Bill's waiting face, and said
      quietly, in the despicable slang of the epoch and region:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a go! Suppose we do."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW IT BECAME FAMOUS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yuba Bill was right in believing that Wiles would lose no time at
      Rawlings. He left there on a fleet horse before Bill had returned with the
      broken-down coach to the last station, and distanced the telegram sent to
      detain him two hours. Leaving the stage road and its dangerous telegraphic
      stations, he pushed southward to Denver over the army trail, in company
      with a half-breed packer, crossing the Missouri before Thatcher had
      reached Julesburg. When Thatcher was at Omaha, Wiles was already in St.
      Louis; and as the Pullman car containing the hero of the "Blue Mass" mine
      rolled into Chicago, Wiles was already walking the streets of the national
      capital. Nevertheless, he had time en route to sink in the waters of the
      North Platte, with many expressions of disgust, the little black
      portmanteau belonging to Thatcher, containing his dressing case, a few
      unimportant letters, and an extra shirt, to wonder why simple men did not
      travel with their important documents and valuables, and to set on foot
      some prudent and cautious inquiries regarding his own lost carpet bag and
      its important contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for these trifles he had every reason to be satisfied with the
      progress of his plans. "It's all right," said Mrs. Hopkinson merrily;
      "while you and Gashwiler have been working with your 'stock,' and treating
      the whole world as if it could be bribed, I've done more with that
      earnest, self-believing, self-deceiving, and perfectly pathetic Roscommon
      than all you fellows put together. Why, I've told his pitiful story, and
      drawn tears from the eyes of Senators and Cabinet Ministers. More than
      that, I've introduced him into society, put him in a dress coat,&mdash;such
      a figure!&mdash;and you know how the best folk worship everything that is
      outre as the sincere thing. I've made him a complete success. Why, only
      the other night, when Senator Misnancy and Judge Fitzdawdle were here,
      after making him tell his story,&mdash;which you know I think he really
      believes,&mdash;I sang 'There came to the beach a poor Exile of Erin,' and
      my husband told me afterwards it was worth at least a dozen votes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But about this rival of yours,&mdash;this niece of Garcia's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another of your blunders; you men know nothing of women. Firstly, she's a
      swarthy little brunette, with dots for eyes; and strides like a man,
      dresses like a dowdy, don't wear stays, and has no style. Then, she's a
      single woman, and alone; and, although she affects to be an artist, and
      has Bohemian ways, don't you see she can't go into society without a
      chaperon or somebody to go with her? Nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," persisted Wiles, "she must have some power; there's Judge Mason and
      Senator Peabody, who are constantly talking about her; and Dinwiddie of
      Virginia escorted her through the Capitol the other day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Hopkinson laughed. "Mason and Peabody aspire to be thought
      literary and artistic, and Dinwiddie wanted to pique ME!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Thatcher is no fool&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Thatcher a lady's man?" queried the lady suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly, I should say," responded Wiles. "He pretends to be absorbed in
      his swindle and devoted to his mine; and I don't think that even you&mdash;"
      he stopped with a slight sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, you are misunderstanding me again, and, what is worse, you are
      misunderstanding your case. Thatcher is pleased with her because he has
      probably seen no one else. Wait till he comes to Washington and has an
      opportunity for comparison;" and she cast a frank glance at her mirror,
      where Wiles, with a sardonic bow, left her standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler was quite as confident of his own success with Congress. "We
      are within a few days of the end of the session. We will manage to have it
      taken up and rushed through before that fellow Thatcher knows what he is
      about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it could be done before he gets here," said Wiles, "it's a reasonably
      sure thing. He is delayed two days: he might have been delayed longer."
      Here Mr. Wiles sighed. If the accident had happened on a mountain road,
      and the stage had been precipitated over the abyss, what valuable time
      would have been saved, and success become a surety. But Mr. Wiles's
      functions as an advocate did not include murder; at least, he was doubtful
      if it could be taxed as costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We need have no fears, sir," resumed Mr. Gashwiler; "The matter is now in
      the hands of the highest tribunal of appeal in the country. It will meet,
      sir, with inflexible justice. I have already prepared some remarks&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way," interrupted Wiles infelicitously, "where's your young man,&mdash;your
      private secretary,&mdash;Dobbs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Congressman for a moment looked confused. "He is not here. And I must
      correct your error in applying that term to him. I have never put my
      confidence in the hands of any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you introduced him to me as your secretary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A mere honorary title, sir. A brevet rank. I might, it is true, have
      thought to repose such a trust in him. But I was deceived, sir, as I fear
      I am too apt to be when I permit my feelings as a man to overcome my duty
      as an American legislator. Mr. Dobbs enjoyed my patronage and the
      opportunity it gave me to introduce him into public life only to abuse it.
      He became, I fear, deeply indebted. His extravagance was unlimited, his
      ambition unbounded, but without, sir, a cash basis. I advanced money to
      him from time to time upon the little property you so generously extended
      to him for his services. But it was quickly dissipated. Yet, sir, such is
      the ingratitude of man that his family lately appealed to me for
      assistance. I felt it was necessary to be stern, and I refused. I would
      not for the sake of his family say anything, but I have missed, sir, books
      from my library. On the day after he left, two volumes of Patent Office
      reports and a Blue Book of Congress, purchased that day by me at a store
      on Pennsylvania avenue, were MISSING,&mdash;missing! I had difficulty,
      sir, great difficulty in keeping it from the papers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Wiles had heard the story already from Gashwiler's acquaintances,
      with more or less free comment on the gifted legislator's economy, he
      could not help thinking that the difficulty had been great indeed. But he
      only fixed his malevolent eye on Gashwiler and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he is gone, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you've made an enemy of him? That's bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler tried to look dignifiedly unconcerned; but something in his
      visitor's manner made him uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say it is bad, if you have. Listen. Before I left here, I found at a
      boardinghouse where he had boarded, and still owed a bill, a trunk which
      the landlord retained. Opening it, I found some letters and papers to
      yours, with certain memoranda of his, which I thought ought to be in YOUR
      possession. As an alleged friend of his, I redeemed the trunk by paying
      the amount of his bill, and secured the more valuable papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gashwiler, whose face had grown apoplectically suffused as Wiles went on,
      at last gasped: "But you got the trunk, and have the papers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately, no; and that's why it's bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, good God! what have you done with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've lost them somewhere on the Overland Road."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler sat for a few moments speechless, vacillating between a
      purple rage and a pallid fear. Then he said hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are all blank forgeries,&mdash;every one of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" said Wiles, smiling blandly on his dexter side, and enjoying the
      whole scene malevolently with his sinister eye. "YOUR papers are all
      genuine, and I won't say are not all right, but unfortunately I had in the
      same bag some memoranda of my own for the use of my client, that, you
      understand, might be put to some bad use if found by a clever man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two rascals looked at each other. There is on the whole really very
      little "honor among thieves,"&mdash;at least great ones,&mdash;and the
      inferior rascal succumbed at the reflection of what HE might do if he were
      in the other rascal's place. "See here, Wiles," he said, relaxing his
      dignity with the perspiration that oozed from every pore, and made the
      collar of his shirt a mere limp rag. "See here, WE"&mdash;this first use
      of the plural was equivalent to a confession&mdash;"we must get them
      papers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Wiles coolly, "if we CAN, and if Thatcher doesn't get
      wind of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was on the coach when I lost them, coming East."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gashwiler paled again. In the emergency he had recourse to the
      sideboard and a bottle, forgetting Wiles. Ten minutes before Wiles would
      have remained seated; but it is recorded that he rose, took the bottle
      from the gifted Gashwiler's fingers, helped himself FIRST, and then sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but, my boy," said Gashwiler, now rapidly changing situations with
      the cooler Wiles; "yes, but, old fellow," he added, poking Wiles with a
      fat forefinger, "don't you see the whole thing will be up before he gets
      here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Wiles gloomily, "but those lazy, easy, honest men have a way
      of popping up just at the nick of time. They never need hurry; all things
      wait for them. Why, don't you remember that on the very day Mrs. Hopkinson
      and I and you got the President to sign that patent, that very day one of
      them d&mdash;n fellows turns up from San Francisco or Australia, having
      taken his own time to get here,&mdash;gets here about half an hour after
      the President had signed the patent and sent it over to the office, finds
      the right man to introduce him to the President, has a talk with him,
      makes him sign an order countermanding its issuance, and undoes all that
      has been done in six years in one hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but Congress is a tribunal that does not revoke its decrees," said
      Gashwiler with a return of his old manner; "at least," he added, observing
      an incredulous shrug in the shoulder of his companion, "at least DURING
      THE SESSION."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see," said Wiles, quietly taking his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see, sir," said the member from Remus with dignity.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT CULTURE DID FOR IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      There was at this time in the Senate of the United States an eminent and
      respected gentleman, scholarly, orderly, honorable, and radical,&mdash;the
      fit representative of a scholarly, orderly, honorable, and radical
      Commonwealth. For many years he had held his trust with conscious
      rectitude, and a slight depreciation of other forms of merit; and for as
      many years had been as regularly returned to his seat by his constituency
      with equally conscious rectitude in themselves and an equal skepticism
      regarding others. Removed by his nature beyond the reach of certain
      temptations, and by circumstances beyond even the knowledge of others, his
      social and political integrity was spotless. An orator and practical
      debater, his refined tastes kept him from personality, and the public
      recognition of the complete unselfishness of his motives and the magnitude
      of his dogmas protected him from scurrility. His principles had never been
      appealed to by a bribe; he had rarely been approached by an emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of polished taste in art and literature, and possessing the means to
      gratify it, his luxurious home was filled with treasures he had himself
      collected, and further enhanced by the stamp of his appreciation. His
      library had not only the elegance of adornment that his wealth could bring
      and his taste approve, but a certain refined negligence of habitual use,
      and the easy disorder of the artist's workshop. All this was quickly noted
      by a young girl who stood on its threshold at the close of a dull January
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The card that had been brought to the Senator bore the name of "Carmen de
      Haro"; and modestly in the right hand corner, in almost microscopic
      script, the further description of herself as "Artist." Perhaps the
      picturesqueness of the name, and its historic suggestion caught the
      scholar's taste, for when to his request, through his servant, that she
      would be kind enough to state her business, she replied as frankly that
      her business was personal to himself, he directed that she should be
      admitted. Then entrenching himself behind his library table, overlooking a
      bastion of books, and a glacis of pamphlets and papers, and throwing into
      his forehead and eyes an expression of utter disqualification for anything
      but the business before him, he calmly awaited the intruder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, and for an instant stood, hesitatingly, framing herself as a
      picture in the door. Mrs. Hopkinson was right,&mdash;she had "no style,"
      unless an original and half-foreign quaintness could be called so. There
      was a desperate attempt visible to combine an American shawl with the
      habits of a mantilla, and it was always slipping from one shoulder, that
      was so supple and vivacious as to betray the deficiencies of an education
      in stays. There was a cluster of black curls around her low forehead,
      fitting her so closely as to seem to be a part of the seal-skin cap she
      wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, from the force of habit, she attempted to put her shawl over her
      head and talk through the folds gathered under her chin, but an astonished
      look from the Senator checked her. Nevertheless, he felt relieved, and
      rising, motioned her to a chair with a heartiness he would have scarcely
      shown to a Parisian toilleta. And when, with two or three quick, long
      steps, she reached his side, and showed, a frank, innocent, but strong and
      determined little face, feminine only in its flash of eye and beauty of
      lip and chin curves, he put down the pamphlet he had taken up somewhat
      ostentatiously, and gently begged to know her business.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I have once before spoken of her voice,&mdash;an organ more often
      cultivated by my fair country-women for singing than for speaking, which,
      considering that much of our practical relations with the sex are carried
      on without the aid of an opera score, seems a mistaken notion of theirs,&mdash;and
      of its sweetness, gentle inflexion, and musical emphasis. She had the
      advantage of having been trained in a musical language, and came of a race
      with whom catarrhs and sore throats were rare. So that in a few brief
      phrases she sang the Senator into acquiescence as she imparted the plain
      libretto of her business,&mdash;namely, a "desire to see some of his rare
      engravings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the engravings in question were certain etchings of the early Great
      Apprentices of the art, and were, I am happy to believe, extremely rare.
      From my unprofessional view they were exceedingly bad,&mdash;showing the
      mere genesis of something since perfected, but dear, of course, to the
      true collector's soul. I don't believe that Carmen really admired them
      either. But the minx knew that the Senator prided himself on having the
      only "pot-hooks" of the great "A," or the first artistic efforts of "B,"&mdash;I
      leave the real names to be filled in by the connoisseur,&mdash;and the
      Senator became interested. For the last year, two or three of these
      abominations had been hanging in his study, utterly ignored by the casual
      visitor. But here was appreciation! "She was," she added, "only a poor
      young artist, unable to purchase such treasures, but equally unable to
      resist the opportunity afforded her, even at the risk of seeming bold, or
      of obtruding upon a great man's privacy," &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      This flattery, which, if offered in the usual legal tender of the country,
      would have been looked upon as counterfeit, delivered here in a foreign
      accent, with a slightly tropical warmth, was accepted by the Senator as
      genuine. These children of the Sun are so impulsive! We, of course, feel a
      little pity for the person who thus transcends our standard of good taste
      and violates our conventional canon,&mdash;but they are always sincere.
      The cold New Englander saw nothing wrong in one or two direct and
      extravagant compliments, that would have insured his visitor's early
      dismissal if tendered in the clipped metallic phrases of the Commonwealth
      he represented.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that in a few moments the black, curly head of the little artist and
      the white, flowing locks of the Senator were close together bending over
      the rack that contained the engravings. It was then that Carmen, listening
      to a graphic description of the early rise of Art in the Netherlands,
      forgot herself and put her shawl around her head, holding its folds in her
      little brown hand. In this situation they were, at different times during
      the next two hours, interrupted by five Congressmen, three Senators, a
      Cabinet officer, and a Judge of the Supreme Bench,&mdash;each of whom was
      quickly but courteously dismissed. Popular sentiment, however, broke out
      in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm blanked, but this gets me." (The speaker was a Territorial
      delegate.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "At his time o' life, too, lookin' over pictures with a gal young enough
      to be his grandchild." (This from a venerable official, since suspected of
      various erotic irregularities.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "She don't handsome any." (The honorable member from Dakota.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "This accounts for his protracted silence during the sessions." (A serious
      colleague from the Senator's own State.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, blank it all!" (Omnes.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Four went home to tell their wives. There are few things more touching in
      the matrimonial compact than the superb frankness with which each confides
      to each the various irregularities of their friends. It is upon these
      sacred confidences that the firm foundations of marriage rest unshaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the objects of this comment, at least ONE of them, were quite
      oblivious. "I trust," said Carmen, timidly, when they had for the fourth
      time regarded in rapt admiration an abominable something by some Dutch
      wood-chopper, "I trust I am not keeping you from your great friends:"&mdash;her
      pretty eyelids were cast down in tremulous distress:&mdash;"I should never
      forgive myself. Perhaps it is important business of the State?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, no! THEY will come again,&mdash;it's THEIR business."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator meant it kindly. It was as near the perilous edge of a
      compliment as your average cultivated Boston man ever ventures, and Carmen
      picked it up, femininely, by its sentimental end. "And I suppose I shall
      not trouble you again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall always be proud to place the portfolio at your disposal. Command
      me at any time," said the Senator, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are kind. You are good," said Carmen, "and I&mdash;I'm but,&mdash;look
      you,&mdash;only a poor girl from California, that you know not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, I know your country well." And indeed he could have told her
      the exact number of bushels of wheat to the acre in her own county of
      Monterey, its voting population, its political bias. Yet of the more
      important product before him, after the manner of book-read men, he knew
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen was astonished, but respectful. It transpired presently that she
      was not aware of the rapid growth of the silk worm in her own district,
      knew nothing of the Chinese question, and very little of the American
      mining laws. Upon these questions the Senator enlightened her fully. "Your
      name is historic, by the way," he said pleasantly. "There was a Knight of
      Alcantara, a 'De Haro,' one of the emigrants with Las Casas."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen nodded her head quickly, "Yes; my great-great-great-g-r-e-a-t
      grandfather!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. I am the niece of Victor Castro, who married my father's
      sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Victor Castro of the 'Blue Mass' mine?" asked the Senator abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the Senator been of the Gashwiler type, he would have expressed
      himself, after the average masculine fashion, by a long-drawn whistle. But
      his only perceptible appreciation of a sudden astonishment and suspicion
      in his mind was a lowering of the social thermometer of the room so
      decided that poor Carmen looked up innocently, chilled, and drew her shawl
      closer around her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have something more to ask," said Carmen, hanging her head,&mdash;"it
      is a great, oh, a very great favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator had retreated behind his bastion of books again, and was
      visibly preparing for an assault. He saw it all now. He had been, in some
      vague way, deluded. He had given confidential audience to the niece of one
      of the Great Claimants before Congress. The inevitable axe had come to the
      grindstone. What might not this woman dare ask of him? He was the more
      implacable that he felt he had already been prepossessed&mdash;and
      honestly prepossessed&mdash;in her favor. He was angry with her for having
      pleased him. Under the icy polish of his manner there were certain Puritan
      callosities caused by early straight-lacing. He was not yet quite free
      from his ancestor's cheerful ethics that Nature, as represented by an
      Impulse, was as much to be restrained as Order represented by a Quaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without apparently noticing his manner, Carmen went on, with a certain
      potential freedom of style, gesture, and manner scarcely to be indicated
      in her mere words. "You know, then, I am of Spanish blood, and that, what
      was my adopted country, our motto was, 'God and Liberty.' It was of you,
      sir,&mdash;the great Emancipator,&mdash;the apostle of that Liberty,&mdash;the
      friend of the down-trodden and oppressed,&mdash;that I, as a child, first
      knew. In the histories of this great country I have read of you, I have
      learned your orations. I have longed to hear you in your own pulpit
      deliver the creed of my ancestors. To hear you, of yourself, speak, ah!
      Madre de Dios! what shall I say,&mdash;speak the oration eloquent,&mdash;to
      make the&mdash;what you call&mdash;the debate, that is what I have for so
      long hoped. Eh! Pardon,&mdash;you are thinking me foolish,&mdash;wild, eh?&mdash;a
      small child,&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Becoming more and more dialectical as she went on, she said suddenly, "I
      have you of myself offended. You are mad of me as a bold, bad child? It is
      so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator, as visibly becoming limp and weak again behind his
      entrenchments, managed to say, "Oh, no!" then, "really!" and finally,
      "Tha-a-nks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am here but for a day. I return to California in a day, as it were
      to-morrow. I shall never, never hear you speak in your place in the
      Capitol of this great country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator said hastily that he feared&mdash;he in fact was convinced&mdash;that
      his duty during this session was required more at his desk, in the
      committee work, than in speaking, &amp;c., &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Carmen sadly, "it is true, then, all this that I have heard. It
      is true that what they have told me,&mdash;that you have given up the
      great party,&mdash;that your voice is not longer heard in the old&mdash;what
      you call this&mdash;eh&mdash;the old ISSUES?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If any one has told you that, Miss De Haro," responded the Senator
      sharply, "he has spoken foolishly. You have been misinformed. May I ask
      who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Carmen, "I know not! It is in the air! I am a stranger. Perhaps
      I am deceived. But it is of all. I say to them, When shall I hear him
      speak? I go day after day to the Capitol, I watch him,&mdash;the great
      Emancipator,&mdash;but it is of business, eh?&mdash;it is the claim of
      that one, it is the tax, eh? it is the impost, it is the post-office, but
      it is the great speech of human rights&mdash;never, NEVER. I say, 'How
      arrives all this?' And some say, and shake their heads, 'never again he
      speaks.' He is what you call 'played&mdash;yes, it is so, eh?&mdash;played
      out.' I know it not,&mdash;it is a word from Bos-ton, perhaps? They say he
      has&mdash;eh, I speak not the English well&mdash;the party he has shaken,
      'shook,'&mdash;yes,&mdash;he has the party 'shaken,' eh? It is right,&mdash;it
      is the language of Bos-ton, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Permit me to say, Miss De Haro," returned the Senator, rising with some
      asperity, "that you seem to have been unfortunate in your selection of
      acquaintances, and still more so in your ideas of the derivations of the
      English tongue. The&mdash;er&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;expressions you have
      quoted are not common to Boston, but emanate, I believe, from the West."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen de Haro contritely buried everything but her black eyes in her
      shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one," he continued, more gently, sitting down again, "has the right to
      forecast from my past what I intend to do in the future, or designate the
      means I may choose to serve the principles I hold or the party I
      represent. Those are MY functions. At the same time, should occasion&mdash;or
      opportunity&mdash;for we are within a day or two of the close of the
      Session&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," interrupted Carmen, sadly, "I see,&mdash;it will be some business,
      some claim, something for somebody,&mdash;ah! Madre de Dios,&mdash;you
      will not speak, and I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you think of returning?" asked the Senator, with grave
      politeness; "when are we to lose you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall stay to the last,&mdash;to the end of the Session," said Carmen.
      "And NOW I shall go." She got up and pulled her shawl viciously over her
      shoulders, with a pretty pettishness, perhaps the most feminine thing she
      had done that evening. Possibly, the most genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator smiled affably: "You do not deserve to be disappointed in
      either case; but it is later than you imagine; let me help you on the
      shorter distance in my carriage; it is at the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied her gravely to the carriage. As it rolled away, she buried
      her little figure in its ample cushions and chuckled to herself, albeit a
      little hysterically. When she had reached her destination, she found
      herself crying, and hastily, and somewhat angrily, dried her eyes as she
      drew up at the door of her lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have you prospered?" asked Mr. Harlowe, of counsel for Royal
      Thatcher, as he gallantly assisted her from the carriage. "I have been
      waiting here for two hours; your interview must have been prolonged,&mdash;that
      was a good sign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't ask me now," said Carmen, a little savagely, "I'm worn out and
      tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harlowe bowed. "I trust you will be better to-morrow, for we expect
      our friend, Mr. Thatcher."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen's brown cheek flushed slightly. "He should have been here before.
      Where is he? What was he doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was snowed up on the plains. He is coming as fast as steam can carry
      him; but he may be too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer lingered. "How did you find the great New-England Senator?" he
      asked with a slight professional levity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen was tired, Carmen was worried, Carmen was a little
      self-reproachful, and she kindled easily. Consequently she said icily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I found him A GENTLEMAN!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW IT BECAME UNFINISHED BUSINESS
    </h3>
    <p>
      The closing of the &mdash;&mdash; Congress was not unlike the closing of
      the several preceding Congresses. There was the same unbusiness-like,
      impractical haste; the same hurried, unjust, and utterly inadequate
      adjustment of unfinished, ill-digested business, that would not have been
      tolerated for a moment by the sovereign people in any private interest
      they controlled. There were frauds rushed through; there were
      long-suffering, righteous demands shelved; there were honest, unpaid debts
      dishonored by scant appropriations; there were closing scenes which only
      the saving sense of American humor kept from being utterly vile. The
      actors, the legislators themselves, knew it, and laughed at it; the
      commentators, the Press, knew it and laughed at it; the audience, the
      great American people, knew it and laughed at it. And nobody for an
      instant conceived that it ever, under any circumstances, might be
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The claim of Roscommon was among the Unfinished Business. The claimant
      himself, haggard, pathetic, importunate, and obstinate, was among the
      Unfinished Business. Various Congressmen, more or less interested in the
      success of the claim, were among the Unfinished Business. The member from
      Fresno, who had changed his derringer for a speech against the claimant,
      was among the Unfinished Business. The gifted Gashwiler, uneasy in his
      soul over certain other Unfinished Business in the shape of his missing
      letters, but dropping oil and honey as he mingled with his brothers, was
      King of Misrule and Lord of the Unfinished Business. Pretty Mrs.
      Hopkinson, prudently escorted by her husband, but imprudently ogled by
      admiring Congressmen, lent the charm of her presence to the finishing of
      Unfinished Business. One or two editors, who had dreams of a finished
      financial business, arising out of Unfinished Business, were there also,
      like ancient bards, to record with paean or threnody the completion of
      Unfinished Business. Various unclean birds, scenting carrion in Unfinished
      Business, hovered in the halls or roosted in the Lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lower house, under the tutelage of the gifted Gashwiler, drank deeply
      of Roscommon and his intoxicating claim, and passed the half-empty bottle
      to the Senate as Unfinished Business. But, alas! in the very rush, and
      storm, and tempest of the unfinishing business, an unlooked-for
      interruption arose in the person of a great Senator whose power none could
      oppose, whose right to free and extended utterance at all times none could
      gainsay. A claim for poultry, violently seized by the army of Sherman
      during his march through Georgia, from the hen-coop of an alleged loyal
      Irishman, opened a constitutional question, and with it the lips of the
      great Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      For seven hours he spoke eloquently, earnestly, convincingly. For seven
      hours the old issues of party and policy were severally taken up and
      dismissed in the old forcible rhetoric that had early made him famous.
      Interruptions from other Senators, now forgetful of Unfinished Business,
      and wild with reanimated party zeal; interruptions from certain Senators
      mindful of Unfinished Business, and unable to pass the Roscommon bottle,
      only spurred him to fresh exertion. The tocsin sounded in the Senate was
      heard in the lower house. Highly-excited members congregated at the doors
      of the Senate, and left Unfinished Business to take care of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to itself for seven hours, Unfinished Business gnashed its false
      teeth and tore its wig in impotent fury in corridor and hall. For seven
      hours the gifted Gashwiler had continued the manufacture of oil and honey,
      whose sweetness, however, was slowly palling upon the congressional lip;
      for seven hours Roscommon and friends beat with impatient feet the lobby,
      and shook fists, more or less discolored, at the distinguished Senator.
      For seven hours the one or two editors were obliged to sit and calmly
      compliment the great speech which that night flashed over the wires of a
      continent with the old electric thrill. And, worse than all, they were
      obliged to record with it the closing of the &mdash;&mdash; Congress, with
      more than the usual amount of Unfinished Business.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little group of friends surrounded the great Senator with hymns of
      praise and congratulations. Old adversaries saluted him courteously as
      they passed by with the respect of strong men. A little woman with a shawl
      drawn over her shoulders, and held with one small brown hand, approached
      him timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I speak not the English well," she said gently, "but I have read much. I
      have read in the plays of your Shakspeare. I would like to say to you the
      words of Rosalind to Orlando when he did fight: 'Sir you have wrestled
      well, and have overthrown more than your enemies.'" And with these words
      she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet not so quickly but that pretty Mrs. Hopkinson, coming,&mdash;as
      Victrix always comes to Victor, to thank the great Senator, albeit the
      faces of her escorts were shrouded in gloom,&mdash;saw the shawled figure
      disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," she said, pinching Wiles mischievously, "there! that's the woman
      you were afraid of. Look at her. Look at that dress. Ah, Heavens! look at
      that shawl. Didn't I tell you she had no style?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is she?" said Wiles sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carmen de Haro, of course," said the lady vivaciously. "What are you
      hurrying away so for? You're absolutely pulling me along."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wiles had just caught sight of the travel-worn face of Royal Thatcher
      among the crowd that thronged the stair-case. Thatcher appeared pale and
      distrait: Mr. Harlowe, his counsel, at his side, rallied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one would think you had just got a new lease of your property, and
      escaped a great swindle. What's the matter with you? Miss De Haro passed
      us just now. It was she who spoke to the Senator. Why did you not
      recognize her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking," said Thatcher gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you take things coolly! And certainly you are not very
      demonstrative towards the woman who saved you to-day. For, as sure as you
      live, it was she who drew that speech out of the Senator."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher did not reply, but moved away. He HAD noticed Carmen de Haro, and
      was about to greet her with mingled pleasure and embarrassment. But he had
      heard her compliment to the Senator, and this strong, preoccupied,
      automatic man, who only ten days before had no thought beyond his
      property, was now thinking more of that compliment to another than of his
      success; and was beginning to hate the Senator who had saved him, the
      lawyer who stood beside him, and even the little figure that had tripped
      down the steps unconscious of him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AND WHO FORGOT IT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was somewhat inconsistent with Royal Thatcher's embarrassment and
      sensitiveness that he should, on leaving the Capitol, order a carriage and
      drive directly to the lodgings of Miss De Haro. That on finding she was
      not at home, he should become again sulky and suspicious, and even be
      ashamed of the honest impulse that led him there, was, I suppose, manlike
      and natural. He felt that he had done all the courtesy required; he had
      promptly answered her dispatch with his presence. If she chose to be
      absent at such a moment, HE had at least done HIS duty. In short, there
      was scarcely any absurdity of the imagination which this once practical
      man did not permit himself to indulge in, yet always with a certain
      consciousness that he was allowing his feelings to run away with him,&mdash;a
      fact that did not tend to make him better humored, and rather inclined him
      to place the responsibility of the elopement on somebody else. If Miss De
      Haro had been home, &amp;c. &amp;c., and not going into ecstasies over
      speeches, &amp;c. &amp;c., and had attended to her business, i. e., being
      exactly what he had supposed her to be,&mdash;all this would not have
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am aware that this will not heighten the reader's respect for my hero.
      But I fancy that the imperceptible progress of a sincere passion in the
      matured strong man is apt to be marked with even more than the usual haste
      and absurdity of callous youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fever that runs riot in the veins of the robust is apt to pass your
      ailing weakling by. Possibly there may be some immunity in inoculation. It
      is Lothario who is always self-possessed and does and says the right
      thing, while poor honest Coelebs becomes ridiculous with genuine emotion.

    <p>
      He rejoined his lawyer in no very gracious mood. The chambers occupied by
      Mr. Harlowe were in the basement of a private dwelling once occupied and
      made historic by an Honorable Somebody, who, however, was remembered only
      by the landlord and the last tenant. There were various shelves in the
      walls divided into compartments, sarcastically known as "pigeon holes," in
      which the dove of peace had never rested, but which still perpetuated, in
      their legends, the feuds and animosities of suitors now but common dust
      together. There was a portrait, apparently of a cherub, which on nearer
      inspection turned out to be a famous English Lord Chancellor in his
      flowing wig.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were books with dreary, unenlivening titles,&mdash;egotistic always,
      as recording Smith's opinions on this, and Jones's commentaries on that.
      There was a hand bill tacked on the wall, which at first offered hilarious
      suggestions of a circus or a steamboat excursion, but which turned out
      only to be a sheriff's sale. There were several oddly-shaped packages in
      newspaper wrappings, mysterious and awful in dark corners, that might have
      contained forgotten law papers or the previous week's washing of the
      eminent counsel. There were one or two newspapers, which at first offered
      entertaining prospects to the waiting client, but always proved to be a
      law record or a Supreme Court decision. There was the bust of a late
      distinguished jurist, which apparently had never been dusted since he
      himself became dust, and had already grown a perceptibly dusty moustache
      on his severely-judicial upper lip. It was a cheerless place in the
      sunshine of day; at night, when it ought, by every suggestion of its dusty
      past, to have been left to the vengeful ghosts, the greater part of whose
      hopes and passions were recorded and gathered there; when in the dark the
      dead hands of forgotten men were stretched from their dusty graves to
      fumble once more for their old title deeds; at night, when it was lit up
      by flaring gaslight, the hollow mockery of this dissipation was so
      apparent that people in the streets, looking through the illuminated
      windows, felt as if the privacy of a family vault had been intruded upon
      by body-snatchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Royal Thatcher glanced around the room, took in all its dreary suggestions
      in a half-weary, half-indifferent sort of way, and dropped into the
      lawyer's own revolving chair as that gentleman entered from the adjacent
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you got back soon, I see," said Harlowe briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said his client, without looking up, and with this notable
      distinction between himself and all other previous clients, that he seemed
      absolutely less interested than the lawyer. "Yes, I'm here; and, upon my
      soul, I don't exactly know why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told me of certain papers you had discovered," said the lawyer
      suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes," returned Thatcher with a slight yawn. "I've got here some
      papers somewhere;"&mdash;he began to feel in his coat pocket languidly;&mdash;"but,
      by the way, this is a rather dreary and God-forsaken sort of place! Let's
      go up to Welker's, and you can look at them over a bottle of champagne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After I've looked at them, I've something to show you, myself," said
      Harlowe; "and as for the champagne, we'll have that in the other room, by
      and by. At present I want to have my head clear, and yours too,&mdash;if
      you'll oblige me by becoming sufficiently interested in your own affairs
      to talk to me about them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher was gazing abstractedly at the fire. He started. "I dare say," he
      began, "I'm not very interesting; yet it's possible that my affairs have
      taken up a little too much of my time. However,&mdash;" he stopped, took
      from his pocket an envelope, and threw it on the desk,&mdash;"there are
      some papers. I don't know what value they may be; that is for you to
      determine. I don't know that I've any legal right to their possession,&mdash;that
      is for you to say, too. They came to me in a queer way. On the overland
      journey here I lost my bag, containing my few traps and some letters and
      papers 'of no value,' as the advertisements say, 'to any but the owner.'
      Well, the bag was lost, but the stage driver declares that it was stolen
      by a fellow-passenger,&mdash;a man by the name of Giles, or Stiles, or
      Piles&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wiles," said Harlowe earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," continued Thatcher, suppressing a yawn; "yes, I guess you're right,&mdash;Wiles.
      Well, the stage driver, finally believing this, goes to work and quietly
      and unostentatiously steals&mdash;I say, have you got a cigar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get you one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlowe disappeared in the adjoining room. Thatcher dragged Harlowe's
      heavy, revolving desk chair, which never before had been removed from its
      sacred position, to the fire, and began to poke the coals abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlowe reappeared with cigars and matches. Thatcher lit one mechanically,
      and said, between the pulls:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you&mdash;ever&mdash;talk&mdash;to yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!&mdash;why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I heard your voice just now in the other room. Anyhow, this is
      an awful spooky place. If I stayed here alone half an hour, I'd fancy that
      the Lord Chancellor up there would step down in his robes, out of his
      frame, to keep me company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! When I'm busy, I often sit here and write until after midnight.
      It's so quiet!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;mnably so!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to go back to the papers. Somebody stole your bag, or you lost it.
      YOU stole&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The driver stole," suggested Thatcher, so languidly that it could hardly
      be called an interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we'll say the driver stole, and passed over to you as his
      accomplice, confederate, or receiver, certain papers belonging&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See here, Harlowe, I don't feel like joking in a ghostly law office after
      midnight. Here are your facts. Yuba Bill, the driver, stole a bag from
      this passenger, Wiles, or Smiles, and handed it to me to insure the return
      of my own. I found in it some papers concerning my case. There they are.
      Do with them what you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher turned his eyes again abstractedly to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlowe took out the first paper:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A-w, this seems to be a telegram. Yes, eh? 'Come to Washington at once.&mdash;Carmen
      de Haro.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher started, blushed like a girl, and hurriedly reached for the
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense. That's a mistake. A dispatch I mislaid in the envelope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," said the lawyer dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I had torn it up," continued Thatcher, after an awkward pause.
      I regret to say that here that usually truthful man elaborated a fiction.
      He had consulted it a dozen times a day on the journey, and it was quite
      worn in its enfoldings. Harlowe's quick eye had noticed this, but he
      speedily became interested and absorbed in the other papers. Thatcher
      lapsed into contemplation of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Harlowe, finally turning to his client, "here's enough to
      unseat Gashwiler, or close his mouth. As to the rest, it's good reading&mdash;but
      I needn't tell you&mdash;no LEGAL evidence. But it's proof enough to stop
      them from ever trying it again,&mdash;when the existence of this record is
      made known. Bribery is a hard thing to fix on a man; the only witness is
      naturally particeps criminis;&mdash;but it would not be easy for them to
      explain away this rascal's record. One or two things I don't understand:
      What's this opposite the Hon. X's name, 'Took the medicine nicely, and
      feels better?' and here, just in the margin, after Y's, 'Must be labored
      with?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose our California slang borrows largely from the medical and
      spiritual profession," returned Thatcher. "But isn't it odd that a man
      should keep a conscientious record of his own villainy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlowe, a little abashed at his want of knowledge of American metaphor,
      now felt himself at home. "Well, no. It's not unusual. In one of those
      books yonder there is the record of a case where a man, who had committed
      a series of nameless atrocities, extending over a period of years,
      absolutely kept a memorandum of them in his pocket diary. It was produced
      in Court. Why, my dear fellow, one half our business arises from the fact
      that men and women are in the habit of keeping letters and documents that
      they might&mdash;I don't say, you know, that they OUGHT, that's a question
      of sentiment or ethics&mdash;but that they MIGHT destroy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher half-mechanically took the telegram of poor Carmen and threw it
      in the fire. Harlowe noticed the act and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll venture to say, however, that there's nothing in the bag that YOU
      lost that need give you a moment's uneasiness. It's only your rascal or
      fool who carries with him that which makes him his own detective."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had a friend," continued Harlowe, "a clever fellow enough, but who was
      so foolish as to seriously complicate himself with a woman. He was himself
      the soul of honor, and at the beginning of their correspondence he
      proposed that they should each return the other's letters with their
      answer. They did so for years, but it cost him ten thousand dollars and no
      end of trouble after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked Thatcher simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he was such an egotistical ass as TO KEEP THE LETTER PROPOSING
      IT, which she had duly returned, among his papers as a sentimental record.
      Of course somebody eventually found it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night," said Thatcher, rising abruptly. "If I stayed here much
      longer I should begin to disbelieve my own mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have known of such hereditary traits," returned Harlowe with a laugh.
      "But come, you must not go without the champagne." He led the way to the
      adjacent room, which proved to be only the ante-chamber of another, on the
      threshold of which Thatcher stopped with genuine surprise. It was an
      elegantly furnished library.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sybarite! Why was I never here before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you came as a client; to-night you are my guest. All who enter
      here leave their business, with their hats, in the hall. Look; there isn't
      a law book on those shelves; that table never was defaced by a title deed
      or parchment. You look puzzled? Well, it was a whim of mine to put my
      residence and my work-shop under the same roof, yet so distinct that they
      would never interfere with each other. You know the house above is let out
      to lodgers. I occupy the first floor with my mother and sister, and this
      is my parlor. I do my work in that severe room that fronts the street:
      here is where I play. A man must have something else in life than mere
      business. I find it less harmful and expensive to have my pleasure here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher had sunk moodily in the embracing arms of an easy chair. He was
      thinking deeply; he was fond of books too, and, like all men who have
      fared hard and led wandering lives, he knew the value of cultivated
      repose. Like all men who have been obliged to sleep under blankets and in
      the open air, he appreciated the luxuries of linen sheets and a frescoed
      roof. It is, by the way, only your sick city clerk or your dyspeptic
      clergyman who fancy that they have found in the bad bread, fried steaks,
      and frowzy flannels of mountain picknicking the true art of living. And it
      is a somewhat notable fact that your true mountaineer or your gentleman
      who has been obliged to honestly "rough it," does not, as a general thing,
      write books about its advantages, or implore their fellow mortals to come
      and share their solitude and their discomforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly appreciating the taste and comfort of Harlowe's library, yet
      half-envious of its owner, and half-suspicious that his own earnest life
      for the past few years might have been different, Thatcher suddenly
      started from his seat and walked towards a parlor easel, whereon stood a
      picture. It was Carmen de Haro's first sketch of the furnace and the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see you are taken with that picture," said Harlowe, pausing with the
      champagne bottle in his hand. "You show your good taste. It's been much
      admired. Observe how splendidly that firelight plays over the sleeping
      face of that figure, yet brings out by very contrast its almost death-like
      repose. Those rocks are powerfully handled; what a suggestion of mystery
      in those shadows! You know the painter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher murmured, "Miss De Haro," with a new and rather odd
      self-consciousness in speaking her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And you know the story of the picture of course?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher thought he didn't. Well, no; in fact, he did not remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this recumbent figure was an old Spanish lover of hers, whom she
      believed to have been murdered there. It's a ghastly fancy, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Two things annoyed Thatcher: first the epithet "lover," as applied to
      Concho by another man; second, that the picture belonged to him: and what
      the d&mdash;-l did she mean by&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he broke out finally, "but how did YOU get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I bought it of her. I've been a sort of patron of her ever since I
      found out how she stood towards us. As she was quite alone here in
      Washington, my mother and sister have taken her up, and have been doing
      the social thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long since?" asked Thatcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not long. The day she telegraphed you, she came here to know what she
      could do for us, and when I said nothing could be done except to keep
      Congress off, why, she went and DID IT. For SHE, and she alone, got that
      speech out of the Senator. But," he added, a little mischievously, "you
      seem to know very little about her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;I've been very busy lately," returned
      Thatcher, staring at the picture. "Does she come here often?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, lately, quite often; she was here this evening with mother; was
      here, I think, when you came."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher looked intently at Harlowe. But that gentleman's face betrayed no
      confusion. Thatcher refilled his glass a little awkwardly, tossed off the
      liquor at a draught, and rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, old fellow, you're not going now. I shan't permit it," said
      Harlowe, laying his hand kindly on his client's shoulder. "You're out of
      sorts! Stay here with me to-night. Our accommodations are not large, but
      are elastic. I can bestow you comfortably until morning. Wait here a
      moment while I give the necessary orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher was not sorry to be left alone. In the last half hour he had
      become convinced that his love for Carmen de Haro had been in some way
      most dreadfully abused. While HE was hard at work in California, she was
      being introduced in Washington society by parties with eligible brothers
      who bought her paintings. It is a relief to the truly jealous mind to
      indulge in plurals. Thatcher liked to think that she was already beset by
      hundreds of brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still kept staring at the picture. By and by it faded away in part, and
      a very vivid recollection of the misty, midnight, moonlit walk he had once
      taken with her came back, and refilled the canvas with its magic. He saw
      the ruined furnace; the dark, overhanging masses of rock, the trembling
      intricacies of foliage, and, above all, the flash of dark eyes under a
      mantilla at his shoulder. What a fool he had been! Had he not really been
      as senseless and stupid as this very Concho, lying here like a log? And
      she had loved that man. What a fool she must have thought him that
      evening! What a snob she must think him now!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was startled by a slight rustling in the passage, that ceased almost as
      he turned. Thatcher looked towards the door of the outer office, as if
      half expecting that the Lord Chancellor, like the commander in Don Juan,
      might have accepted his thoughtless invitation. He listened again;
      everything was still. He was conscious of feeling ill at ease and a trifle
      nervous. What a long time Harlowe took to make his preparations. He would
      look out in the hall. To do this it was necessary to turn up the gas. He
      did so, and in his confusion turned it out!
    </p>
    <p>
      Where were the matches? He remembered that there was a bronze something on
      the table that, in the irony of modern decorative taste, might hold ashes
      or matches, or anything of an unpicturesque character. He knocked
      something over, evidently the ink,&mdash;something else,&mdash;this time a
      champagne glass. Becoming reckless, and now groping at random in the
      ruins, he overturned the bronze Mercury on the center table, and then sat
      down hopelessly in his chair. And then a pair of velvet fingers slid into
      his, with the matches, and this audible, musical statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a match you are seeking? Here is of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher flushed, embarrassed, nervous,&mdash;feeling the ridiculousness
      of saying, "Thank you" to a dark somebody,&mdash;struck the match, beheld
      by its brief, uncertain glimmer Carmen de Haro beside him, burned his
      fingers, coughed, dropped the match, and was cast again into outer
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me try!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen struck a match, jumped briskly on the chair, lit the gas, jumped
      lightly down again, and said: "You do like to sit in the dark,&mdash;eh?
      So am I&mdash;sometimes&mdash;alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss De Haro," said Thatcher, with sudden, honest earnestness, advancing
      with outstretched hands, "believe me I am sincerely delighted, overjoyed,
      again to meet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had, however, quickly retreated as he approached, ensconcing herself
      behind the high back of a large antique chair, on the cushion of which she
      knelt. I regret to add also that she slapped his outstretched fingers a
      little sharply with her inevitable black fan as he still advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are not in California. It is Washington. It is after midnight. I am a
      poor girl, and I have to lose&mdash;what you call&mdash;'a character.' You
      shall sit over there,"&mdash;she pointed to the sofa,&mdash;"and I shall
      sit here;" she rested her boyish head on the top of the chair; "and we
      shall talk, for I have to speak to you, Don Royal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher took the seat indicated, contritely, humbly, submissively.
      Carmen's little heart was touched. But she still went on over the back of
      the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Royal," she said, emphasizing each word at him with her fan, "before
      I saw you,&mdash;ever knew of you,&mdash;I was a child. Yes, I was but a
      child! I was a bold, bad child;&mdash;and I was what you call a&mdash;a&mdash;'forgaire'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A what?" asked Thatcher, hesitating between a smile and a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A forgaire!" continued Carmen demurely. "I did of myself write the names
      of ozzer peoples;" when Carmen was excited she lost the control of the
      English tongue; "I did write just to please myself;&mdash;it was my onkle
      that did make of it money;&mdash;you understand, eh? Shall you not speak?
      Must I again hit you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," said Thatcher laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did find out, when I came to you at the mine, that I had forged against
      you the name of Micheltorena. I to the lawyer went, and found that it was
      so&mdash;of a verity&mdash;so! so! all the time. Look at me not now, Don
      Royal;&mdash;it is a 'forgaire' you stare at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carmen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hoosh! Shall I have to hit you again? I did overlook all the papers. I
      found the application: it was written by me. There."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed over the back of her chair an envelope to Thatcher. He opened
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," he said gently, "you repossessed yourself of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that&mdash;'r-r-r-e&mdash;possess'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why!"&mdash;Thatcher hesitated&mdash;"you got possession of this paper,&mdash;this
      innocent forgery,&mdash;again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! You think me a thief as well as a 'forgaire.' Go away! Get up. Get
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear girl&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at the paper! Will you? Oh, you silly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thatcher looked at the paper. In paper, handwriting, age, and stamp it was
      identical with the formal, clerical application of Garcia for the grant.
      The indorsement of Micheltorena was unquestionably genuine. BUT THE
      APPLICATION WAS MADE FOR ROYAL THATCHER. And his own signature was
      imitated to the life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had but one letter of yours wiz your name," said Carmen apologetically;
      "and it was the best poor me could do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you blessed little goose and angel," said Thatcher, with the bold,
      mixed metaphor of amatory genius, "don't you see&mdash;"

      "Ah, you don't like it,&mdash;it is not good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hoosh! There is also an 'old cat' up stairs. And now I have here a
      character. WILL you sit down? Is it of a necessity that up and down you
      should walk and awaken the whole house? There!"&mdash;she had given him a
      vicious dab with her fan as he passed. He sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have not seen me nor written to me for a year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carmen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, you bold, bad boy. Don't you see it is of business that you and
      I talk down here; and it is of business that ozzer people up stairs are
      thinking. Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "D&mdash;n business! See here, Carmen, my darling, tell me"&mdash;I regret
      to say he had by this time got hold of the back of Carmen's chair&mdash;"tell
      me, my own little girl,&mdash;about&mdash;about that Senator. You remember
      what you said to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the old man? Oh, THAT was business. And you say of business, 'd&mdash;n.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Carmen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don Royal!"
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Although Miss Carmen had recourse to her fan frequently during this
      interview, the air must have been chilly, for a moment later, on his way
      down stairs, poor Harlowe, a sufferer from bronchitis, was attacked with a
      violent fit of coughing, which troubled him all the way down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, as he entered the room, "I see you have found Mr.
      Thatcher, and shown those papers. I trust you have, for you've certainly
      had time enough. I am sent by mother to dismiss you all to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmen still in the arm chair, covered with her mantilla, did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you are by this time lawyer enough to know," continued Harlowe,
      "that Miss De Haro's papers, though ingenious, are not legally available,
      unless&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I chose to make her a witness. Harlowe! you're a good fellow! I don't
      mind saying to you that these are papers I prefer that my WIFE should not
      use. We'll leave it for the present&mdash;Unfinished Business."
    </p>
    <p>
      They did. But one evening our hero brought Mrs. Royal Thatcher a paper
      containing a touching and beautiful tribute to the dead Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, Carmen, love, read that. Don't you feel a little ashamed of your&mdash;your&mdash;your
      lobbying&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Carmen promptly. "It was business,&mdash;and if all lobbying
      business was as honest,&mdash;well?&mdash;"
    </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
